Emergency Safety Solutions (ESS) is the brainchild of roadside safety advocates who 
are deeply troubled by the high number of preventable, and often fatal, car accidents 
that occur every day around the world. ESS has taken the lead on analyzing and documenting
roadway fatality data published by the National Highway Transportation Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) and other global government agencies, to identify the root causes 
of crash trends that have previously gone unidentified. We strive to develop new 
strategies and technologies to prevent future accidents that would fall under these 
safety cases.

## ESS Crash Scenarios
Every day, drivers around the world are forced to pull their cars over to the shoulder on busy highways and roads. Dealing with flat tires, fender benders, and overheating engines should not lead to an injury or loss of life.
A recent study of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s fatality data found that during the 10-year period of 2008 to 2017, between 6,500 and 10,000 people lost their lives and more than 500,000 people were injured on roadways in the following scenarios:
1.	A moving vehicle strikes a non-moving, disabled vehicle on or adjacent to the roadway, including multiple car pile-ups;
2.	A pedestrian is struck while attending to disabled vehicle on or adjacent to roadway;
3.	A vehicle runs off the roadway, strikes a fixed object, and the accident goes unnoticed by passersby for hours or days while trapped vehicle occupants expire.
These accidents occur when oncoming drivers do not notice disabled vehicles in time to safely react.
