GREENSBORO, N.C. â€”
One person has died after a crash on I-40 in Greensboro Monday night.

Officials said eastbound lanes of I-40 at Sandy Ridge Road were closed just before 9 p.m. Monday because of a vehicle crash. They reopened Tuesday morning around 2:30 a.m.

Greensboro police said one person was killed.

According to police, a 2010 Acura TSX was being driven eastbound on Interstate 40 when it left the roadway, hit guardrail, and over turned. The vehicle came to rest and caught on fire, but the driver was able to get out of the vehicle. The driver of the Acura then went into the travel lanes of Interstate 40 and was struck by a 2009 Cadillac CTS.

The driver of the Acura was then pronounced deceased at the scene from injuries sustained in the crash. The driver of the Cadillac has not been charged.

Video sent to the WXII 12 newsroom shows firefighters spraying water on a burning car on the side of a road.

The identities of those involved have not been released.
