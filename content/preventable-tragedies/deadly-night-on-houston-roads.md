On the Gulf Freeway at Woodridge, a woman on the freeway caused a chain reaction crash when a pickup driver stopped to avoid hitting her.

When the pickup stopped, the vehicle behind it slammed into the back of the truck. Then, another vehicle rear-ended that vehicle, and yet another vehicle rear-ended that one. In total, four vehicles were involved in the chain-reaction crash.

Seconds later, a different vehicle, which was not involved in the chain-reaction crash, hit the woman. That driver took off, police said.

The pickup had a dash cam, and the footage may help police find the driver who struck the woman. At last check, the woman was in critical condition.
