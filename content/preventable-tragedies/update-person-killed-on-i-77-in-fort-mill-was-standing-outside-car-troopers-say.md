title: "Update: Person killed on I-77 in Fort Mill was standing outside car, troopers say"
---
A person standing along Interstate 77 near a disabled vehicle was killed Tuesday afternoon in a crash that caused traffic to be backed up for miles, officials said.

The wreck happened around 2:30 p.m. on the interstate near Exit 83 in Fort Mill, according to Master Trooper Gary Miller of the S.C. Highway Patrol. Troopers advised motorists to seek other routes because of the backups that lasted into Tuesday evening.

The person who died was standing in the emergency lane area on the left side of the highway near the median when the collision happened, Miller said. That person was struck by a vehicle that swerved left to avoid a disabled vehicle in the left lane, Miller said.
It remains unclear if the person standing near the disabled vehicle was the driver of the vehicle that was disabled in the highway. No other details about the fatal collision have been released.

The York County Coroner’s Office and highway patrol continue to investigate the wreck.
