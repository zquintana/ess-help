LAS VEGAS (FOX5) -- Nevada Highway Patrol was investigating a fatal crash involving a pedestrian Monday morning in the south Las Vegas Valley.

According to NHP, the crash occurred near the I-15 northbound, north of Starr Avenue about 10:30 a.m. on Oct. 4. 

Witnesses told NHP a white utility truck was in the shoulder with hazard lights on. The male driver was outside of truck. A utility van in the far right lane failed to maintain the lane, swerved and hit the man.

The truck driver, identified by the Clark County Coroner's Office as 21-year-old Giovanni Hasakian, was pronounced dead on scene. He died of blunt trauma in an accident, the coroner ruled. 

The other driver stayed on scene, NHP said.
