A runaway tire on I-45 North caused a big, multi-car pileup near downtown Houston early Thursday.

It happened when a tire flew off a Jeep lost and landed in the middle of I-45 near Memorial Drive. Drivers swerving to miss the tire ended up crashing into each other.

Other drivers didn’t see the tire and ran over it, damaging their vehicles with flat tires, busted bumpers — or worse.
