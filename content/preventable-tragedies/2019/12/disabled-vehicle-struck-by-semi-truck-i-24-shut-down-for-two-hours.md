title: Disabled vehicle struck by semi-truck, I-24 shut down for two hours
---


On Dec. 9 at approximately 4 p.m., Joanna Stewart, of Paducah was operating a 2000 Chevrolet truck on I-24 eastbound crossing the I-24 Ohio River bridge.

For an unknown reason, Stewart’s vehicle stopped working, and she coasted to a stop approximately three fourths of the way across the bridge into Kentucky.

As Stewart’s vehicle came to a stop, Matthew Beddall of Lebanon, Tennessee, operating a 2020 Freightliner semi-truck and enclosed trailer, was approaching in the same lane behind Stewart’s disabled vehicle.

Not recognizing the vehicle was disabled and stopped in front of him, the front of the semi struck the rear of the truck, causing the truck to accordion and end up partially underneath the front of the semi.
