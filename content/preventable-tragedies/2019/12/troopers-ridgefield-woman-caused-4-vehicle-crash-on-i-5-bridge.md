The Washington State Patrol says an inattentive driver caused a four-vehicle crash Wednesday night on the southbound span of the Interstate 5 Bridge.

Around 11 p.m., a disabled 2000 Ford Expedition was stopped in the right lane on the bridge, according to a state patrol crash memo. The driver had activated the SUVâ€™s hazard lights and was out of the vehicle, standing on the pedestrian path on the bridge.

Another driver had stopped to help the stranded motorist, parking a BMW sedan in front of the Ford, troopers said.

However, a gray Nissan Altima, driven by 43-year-old Carrie L. Deel of Ridgefield, was southbound in the right lane on the bridge and did not slow down for the stopped vehicles, according to the crash memo. Deel crashed the Nissan into the disabled Ford, which was pushed into the BMW.
