title: Tragic fatal DUI crash in Fresno inspires support for newlywed couple from
  Merced
---


More than $40,000 was raised in just one day through a GoFundme account to help out a Merced woman who was struck by a suspected drunken driver on Sunday morning on Highway 99 in Fresno.

Jennifer Ramos, 28, and her husband Joshua Eisen, 28, were returning to Merced from San Luis Obispo.

The couple had just been involved in a single-car crash on northbound Highway 99 and were standing next to their car on the right shoulder when they were struck.
