Traffic safety officials say to stay in your disabled vehicle until help arrives, but doing just that didnâ€™t prevent three Lansing men from getting hurt in a crash on Friday night, and one of them has now died.

A car on the shoulder had broken down and had its four-way flashers activated when another car in the right lane veered to the right and rammed into it. The three men, ranging in age from 25 to 29, were passengers inside of the disabled vehicle and were taken to Hackley Hospital for treatment, with one of them initially listed in critical condition.
