title: Two men dead, dozens more injured after multi-car crash in Pennsylvania
---


Snow squalls throughout Northeast and central Pennsylvania Wednesday left roads a mess.

In Union County a man died after a crash involving about 30 vehicles.

“It’s one of those things where first you see a few snowflakes and you think oh this isn’t anything and then you see just suddenly a blanket of white,” said State College resident Dawn Rosenbaum.

It set off a chain reaction of about 20 tractor trailers and 10 other vehicles crushed together.
