---


Around 6:45 p.m. Monday, emergency personnel was called to the ramp from I-65 northbound to I-465 eastbound in response to a pedestrian struck.

They arrived to find a critically injured 59-year-old Centerville man lying in the road. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment.

Investigators believe the man pulled his vehicle over to the roadâ€™s shoulder for a possible tire issue. When he got out to check on the problem, the man was struck by a passing vehicle. The vehicle did not stop for the man and left the scene. There were two occupants of the disabled vehicle that witnessed the crash, according to ISP.
