The Kansas Highway Patrol says an Edgerton man was killed after his van struck the back of a disabled semi-truck, causing a chain reaction of collisions Tuesday morning on Interstate 35.

The wreck, which involved seven vehicles, was reported about 10:40 a.m. in the northbound lanes of I-35, south of the 67th Street exit in Merriam.
