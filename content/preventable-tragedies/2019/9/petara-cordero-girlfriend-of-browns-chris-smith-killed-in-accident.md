According to a statement released by the Browns, Smithâ€™s 2019 Lamborghini had a tire malfunction and spun into the median. Both Smith, who was driving, and Cordero, a passenger, exited the car without major injury. Cordero, 26, was then struck by an oncoming vehicle.

Smith was not impaired, nor was he injured, police said.
