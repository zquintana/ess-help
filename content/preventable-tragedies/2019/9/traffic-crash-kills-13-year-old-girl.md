“A semi with a dump-type trailer was parked along the roadway not moving with its hazard lights on,” Morris said. It was waiting there to be loaded with silage that was being cut in an adjacent field, he explained. A vehicle, driven by Stephanie Chase, 37, of Ithaca, ran into the back of the semi killing Mariah Chase, 13, on impact, Morris said.
