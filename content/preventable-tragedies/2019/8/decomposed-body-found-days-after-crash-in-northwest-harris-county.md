---


Deputies said the crash happened around 3 a.m. Friday on Windfern Road near Schooner Lane. Neighbors reported hearing a crash, but no vehicle was found, authorities said.

The Harris County Sheriffâ€™s Office said the driver of the older-model green Lexus was traveling southbound on Windfern but lost control of the vehicle while taking a sharp turn.

Deputies said the vehicle went off the road, hit a turn warning sign, a guardrail and a chain-link fence before traveling about 65 feet into the wooded area.
