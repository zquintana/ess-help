title: Jim Boeheim was at or near the speed limit when fatal crash occurred, DA says
---


Boeheim was behind the wheel of a GMC Acadia that struck and killed 51-year-old Jorge Jimenez at 11:30 p.m. last Wednesday after Boeheim swerved to avoid a disabled vehicle on a dark, icy highway after Syracuseâ€™s game against Louisville. Jimenez was one of four people who had been in the disabled car, which had skidded on a patch of ice into a guardrail in the center median. Only one of the four had made it from the disabled 2011 Dodge Charger, which was blocking two lanes of traffic, into the median when the collision occurred.
