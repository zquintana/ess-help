title: Woman killed after multi-car crash in Spring
---


A woman died early Sunday following a multiple-car crash in Spring, police said. Two sedans were involved in a minor crash shortly after 4 a.m. on northbound I-45, said Commander Kevin Deese of the Houston Police Department. Officials said one of the cars pulled over to the right shoulder and another stopped in the left lane of the freeway.

The driver and passenger of one of the vehicles got out and walked to the back of the car to assess the damage. After a bystander stopped to help, another vehicle barreling down the freeway rear-ended the stopped vehicles and pinned a woman between two cars, Deese said.
