Three people have died since mid-September after getting hit on Triangle highway while checking on their cars after a breakdown.

The most recent incident occurred Monday night on U.S. Highway 15/501 near Cornwallis Road in Durham. Danielle Noel, 30, had car trouble and was standing behind her 2000 Chevrolet Blazer, which was stopped in the right lane with the hazard lights on, when she was hit by a car that didnâ€™t stop, police said.
