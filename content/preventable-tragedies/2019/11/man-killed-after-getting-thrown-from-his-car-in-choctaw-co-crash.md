A McCurtain County man is dead after a crash in Choctaw County Friday

Troopers say Charles Mack, 73, was standing next to the front driver door of his disabled pickup in the northbound lane of Indian Nation Turnpike about eight miles north of Hugo.

Another car headed north, driven by 27-year-old Mikka Sennikoff, struck the passenger side of the pickup.

Mack was hit and thrown by his pickup into a ditch. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
