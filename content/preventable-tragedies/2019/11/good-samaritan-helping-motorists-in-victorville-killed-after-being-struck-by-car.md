A good Samaritan who was assisting others in moving a disabled vehicle off a road on Saturday was killed after a car hit him from behind.

Officials said a Toyota SUV stalled westbound on D Street. The two occupants were attempting to push it out of the roadway when an unidentified man began to help.

A Lexus traveling in the same direction collided into the back of the SUV, trapping the man underneath the vehicle. He died at the scene.
