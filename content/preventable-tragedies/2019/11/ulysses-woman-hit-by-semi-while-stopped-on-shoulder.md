title: Ulysses woman hit by semi while stopped on shoulder
---


A Ulysses woman escaped serious injury after her vehicle, which was stopped on the shoulder of a Kearney County highway, was hit from behind by a semi Sunday evening and sent into a roll.

Another vehicle behind her slowed down as McElroy pulled over, but a semi behind that car was unable to slow and, driving onto the shoulder to avoid a collision with the second car, struck McElroyâ€™s 2011 Ford Ranger.

After impact, the Ranger rolled an unknown number of times, the report stated, coming to rest in the north ditch on its wheels.
