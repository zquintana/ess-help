A family is in mourning after a disabled father, who was working as an Uber driver to help provide for his eight children, was killed in a crash on the Garden State Parkway only days before Thanksgiving.

Stephen Chiarle, 48, of Cape May Court House, New Jersey, was inside his Ford Edge which was stopped on the Garden State Parkway in Little Egg Harbor Township, Sunday morning. The SUV was then hit by another vehicle passing by.
