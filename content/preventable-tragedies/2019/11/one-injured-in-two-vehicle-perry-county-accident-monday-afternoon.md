---


A man was injured Monday afternoon while changing a tire in Perry County after he and his vehicle were hit by the trailer of another vehicle.

The Missouri State Highway Patrol reports the crash occurred when 47-year old Marshall Kilburn of Chaffee was outside of his vehicle replacing a tire on Interstate 55 at the 139 mile marker.

The vehicle crossed the fog line, then the trailer attached to the truck struck the vehicle of Kilburn and also made contact with the man himself.
