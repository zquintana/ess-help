title: Three different crashes cause major traffic on Houston highways, one fatal
---


Houston police said around 2:30 p.m. Tuesday that truck carrying a Gooseneck trailer stalled and pulled over to the middle breakdown lane. Police said the truck driver put warning triangles behind the trailer, but that wasnâ€™t enough with cars zooming by at 60 miles per hour.

Police say a small red car hit the trailer, ejecting the driver of the red car onto the roadway. The driver of the small car did not survive.
