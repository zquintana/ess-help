MDTA police said the situation unfolded around 10 a.m. when a truck hit a disabled vehicle, highlighting the dangers of disabled vehicles on bridges.

MDTA officials said they were responding to the disabled vehicle on the Key Bridge, but unfortunately, before they got there, an international truck hit the disabled Honda Sedan, sending the driver who was standing outside of the vehicle over the side and into the water.

Marine units from the Coast Guard, Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County searched for the man, officials said.

He was found dead after his body retrieved near the bridge.
