title: Bodies identified following fiery crash in Childress County
---


Officials said around 9:50 p.m. an 18-wheeler, and two sedans were traveling south on U.S. 287 near Kirkland during extremely high winds and very bad visibility.

Several vehicles were stopped or moving slowly due to poor visibility.

The driver of the 18-wheeler could not see the slow traffic and crashed into a Ford sedan which then crashed into another vehicle.

The 18-wheeler and Ford sedan ended up in a ditch where both vehicles caught on fire.
