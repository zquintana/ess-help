BRIDGEPORT — A Weston man suffered life-threatening injuries after he apparently ran into traffic on Interstate 95 south Tuesday night and was hit by a vehicle, according to police.

The crash was first reported around 6:15 p.m. Troop G, at the Connecticut State Police barracks in Bridgeport, got several 911 calls about a pedestrian who had been hit by a vehicle on I-95 south near Exit 29.The state police report, released Wednesday, said that the 30-year-old Weston man was driving on the highway’s southbound lanes through Bridgeport when he stopped his car on the right shoulder for an unknown reason and got out.State police said the man “then ran from the right shoulder across the lanes of traffic and was struck in the left lane” by a vehicle. After the collision, the Weston man was found in the left lane of travel.

Bridgeport emergency medical services and firefighters responded to the scene. Medics rushed the Weston man to Bridgeport Hospital with “life-threatening injuries,” state police said.

As crews worked to clear the crash site and investigate, the highway was shut down for hours between Exit 29 and Exit 27.

The incident remains under investigation.
