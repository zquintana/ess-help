A 79-year-old man from Tampa died early Saturday morning after stopping to help a broken-down van on southbound Interstate 275, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

A van traveling I-275 in Tampa broke down in the center lane north of Interstate 4 because of mechanical issues. The Tampa man stopped his moped to help, law enforcement reported. So did one other vehicle.

A Tampa woman, 44, traveling on the interstate did not stop in time, and her car crashed into the moped and vehicle, pushing them into the van. The moped driver died from injuries at the scene, Florida Highway Patrol said.

No other injuries were reported.
