title: "Macon man in car stopped on Eisenhower Parkway is killed when car slams into him"
---
A Macon man died Sunday of injuries he suffered in a car wreck that happened shortly after midnight Saturday. The man who was killed was sitting at the wheel of a car that, for reasons as yet unclear, had stopped along a well-traveled south Macon thoroughfare. The victim, Sonny Chatman Jr., of a Canterbury Road address half a mile or so from the crash scene, died later at a hospital, Bibb County Coroner Leon Jones said. Bibb sheriff’s officials said the crash happened at about 12:30 a.m. just west of the Interstate 75 interchange at Eisenhower Parkway near Laveta Drive, just east of Pio Nono Avenue.

The officials said in a statement that Chatman was in a 2007 Honda Accord that was parked in the roadway when it was struck by an eastbound 2018 Dodge Charger. The driver of the Dodge, a person from Alabama, was not hurt.

Further details of the wreck were not available at midday Monday. But sheriff’s Lt. Sean DeFoe said that according to a witness the Honda that Chatman was in was parked in the left lane of eastbound Eisenhower with its lights off when the Dodge hit the Honda from behind.
