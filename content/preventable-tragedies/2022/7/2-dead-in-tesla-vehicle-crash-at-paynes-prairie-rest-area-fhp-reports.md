title: "2 dead in Tesla vehicle crash at Paynes Prairie rest area, FHP reports"
---
Two people were killed in a Tesla vehicle accident Wednesday after their car ran off an interstate and crashed into a stationary Walmart semi-trailer truck, according to Florida Highway Patrol.

Law enforcement say the vehicle was traveling on Interstate 75 but for unknown reasons exited for the rest area near Paynes Prairie. The vehicle then struck a Walmart Freightliner tractor-trailer that was parked in the resting area.

The driver and passenger in the Tesla, a 66-year-old female and 67-year-old male from Lompoc, California, were pronounced dead at the scene.

Gainesville Fire Rescue responded to the scene to extricate the victims from the car that was trapped beneath the back of the trailer.

FHP did not release the names of the victims and didn't say whether the vehicle was on autopilot, as details will be released following an investigation.

Tesla vehicles crashing while on autopilot have seen an increase in recent years.
