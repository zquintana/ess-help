---
Garland, TX â€” June 15, 2022, 65-year-old Carlos Lopez was injured in a single-vehicle accident on Garland Avenue in Garland.

According to reports the incident happened around 1:40 p.m. on Garland Ave (State Highway 78) near Devonshire Drive. Preliminary investigation suggests Lopez was driving a Pontiac G5 couple north on the roadway, following another vehicle.

The car ahead of him slowed in response to a disabled vehicle partly blocking the lane and Lopez swerved hard right to avoid it. He lost control and the car entered a side-skid, then hit a tree on the road's east side. It spun out after the impact, then hit another tree a short distance further north.

Lopez suffered serious injuries in the crash and was taken to an area hospital. Investigators suspected he was under the influence of alcohol and blood samples were collected for testing.

No further information is available at this time.
