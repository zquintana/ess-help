A Cadet woman was injured Tuesday, July 5, in a two-vehicle accident on I-55 north of Imperial Main Street in Imperial, the Missouri State Highway Patrol reported.

At 3:11 p.m., Jessica L. Dora, 35, of Cadet was a passenger in a parked 2010 Ford F150 on the northbound shoulder of I-55 when a 2009 Mercury Milan driven north by Judith A. Jackson, 59, of St. Louis traveled off the road and struck the rear of the parked vehicle, the report said.

Dora was moderately injured and taken by Rock Township ambulance to Mercy Hospital South in south St. Louis County where she was treated and released, a hospital spokesperson said.

According to the report, Dora, Jackson and the driver-side passenger of the parked F150, Gary M. Homeier, 45, of Imperial, were all wearing seat belts.

Both the F150 and the Milan were totaled, the report said.
