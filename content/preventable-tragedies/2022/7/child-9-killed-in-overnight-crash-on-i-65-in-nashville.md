NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WZTV) — A nine-year-old child died overnight in a wreck on Interstate 65 near Rosa Parks. At least five cars were involved.

A preliminary investigation from Metro Nashville Police shows a 2003 Honda Civic was traveling north on I-65 around 12:30 a.m. when it sideswiped a 2018 GMC Sierra.

Police say the occupants of the Civic, a 28-year-old driver with two children ages 8 and 9, exited the vehicle following the collision and sat on the center concrete median wall. A 2010 Infiniti G27X stopped behind the Civic after the crash.

According to MNPD, the Infiniti was stopped and was later struck by a 2020 Nissan Altima. The Altima forced the Infiniti up the concrete median and struck 9-year-old Za’ryiah Floyd.

A 2022 Audi A3 crashed into the back of the Altima.

Both children were transported to Vanderbilt Children’s Hospital where Floyd was pronounced deceased. The 8-year-old has since been released.

Police say the two children in the GMC Sierra at the time of the crash were not injured.

There were no signs of impairment on any drivers involved. The accident remains under investigation.
