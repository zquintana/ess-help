---
A pedestrian was struck and killed by a disabled vehicle early Sunday morning in Canoe, Alabama, east of Atmore.

A 2013 Dodge Ram pickup driven by 77-year old Jimmy E. Barnes of Panama City struck a vehicle that was broken down on the shoulder of Highway 31 near South Canoe Road.

Alabama State Troopers said the force of the collision pushed the disabled vehicle into 77-year old Ray L. Singleton of Fort Deposit, Alabama, as he stood nearby. Singleton was pronounced deceased at the scene. He was a former resident of Atmore.

A wrecker was in the process of removing the vehicle at the time of the 2:40 a.m. crash.

Troopers have not released further details.
