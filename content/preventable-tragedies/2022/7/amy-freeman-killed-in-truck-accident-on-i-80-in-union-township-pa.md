---
Union Township, PA â€” June 29, 2022, 59-year-old Amy Freeman was killed in a collision with two tractor-trailers on Interstate 80 in Union Township.

According to reports the incident happened around 3:40 p.m. on I-80 near mile marker 107. Preliminary investigation suggests a westbound International 18-wheeler had a mechanical issue while traveling on the highway. Its driver tried to pull onto the south side of the road but stopped, partially disabled, in the left travel lane.

Behind the International truck, Freeman was riding a Victory motorcycle near a westbound Peterbilt tractor-trailer. Reports say the Peterbilt driver crashed into the International, pushing it from the left into the right lane where it hit Freeman's bike. The Peterbilt and the motorcycle both traveled off the road after the collision.

Freeman was fatally injured in the wreck. Both truck drivers were reportedly unhurt.

No further information is currently available.
