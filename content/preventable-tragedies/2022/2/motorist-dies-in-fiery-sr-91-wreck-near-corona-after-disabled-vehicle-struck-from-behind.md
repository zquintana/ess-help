RIVERSIDE, Calif., — Authorities say a motorist was killed in a fiery wreck when their vehicle was struck from behind after becoming disabled while traveling on the 91 Freeway in Riverside Wednesday evening, Feb. 9.

The deadly accident, which happened in the westbound lanes of traffic west of Green River Road, was the first of two fatal collisions to occur on the 91 Freeway overnight.

California Highway Patrol – Riverside officers were initially alerted to a stalled vehicle that was blocking the number one-fast lane just before 10 p.m., CHP Officer Juan Quintero reported today.

“Moments later, they learned the stalled vehicle had been struck by another vehicle,” Quintero explained.

When officials arrived at the scene, they found two involved vehicles, including a Toyota Camry that was fully engulfed in flames and a Toyota Highlander. Both vehicles sustained heavy damage in the collision and the Toyota was completely destroyed by the blaze that erupted after the crash.

After extinguishing the Camry fire, firefighters determined the driver and sole occupant had perished in the collision. The victim’s name has not yet been released, pending notification of the person’s family.

The driver and passenger of the Highlander were transported to a local hospital for treatment of their unspecified

injuries according to Quintero, who said both are continuing to cooperate with CHP.

CHP has not yet ruled out intoxication as a possible contributing factor in the crash and their investigation is active and ongoing.

Anyone who may have witnessed this collision who has not yet provided a statement is encouraged to contact Officer B. Seel of the California Highway Patrol’s Accident Investigation Unit at (951) 637-8000.
