HARRIS COUNTY, Texas — A man was transported by Life Flight after he was struck while outside of his car in an auto-pedestrian crash in northwest Harris County early Monday, according to deputies.

This happened around 12:30 a.m. on the feeder road along Highway 290 heading northwest near Becker Road.

According to Harris County sheriff’s deputies, a Toyota Camry was exiting when he swerved to avoid a disabled Mercedes in the right lane. The driver clipped the Mercedes and hit a 21-year-old man who was outside that vehicle.

The victim was airlifted to the hospital in critical condition, and at last check was still alive.

Deputies said the 67-year-old driver of the Camry stayed at the scene and did not show any signs of intoxication.
