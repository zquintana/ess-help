A Montgomery teen missing since January was found dead this week, according to his family.

LaDarrien Wheat, 18, was last seen on Saturday, Jan. 22. He ate breakfast and lunch with his family, and later that date went to visit his girlfriend.

He left his girlfriend’s home about 6:30 p.m. and wasn’t heard from again.

His parents, Stephanie and Herbert Wheat Sr., said their son was found dead inside his vehicle in a Montgomery area pond.

Montgomery police are not releasing the identity of the body found but said the discovery was made about 3 p.m. Wednesday in the 100 block of Festival Lane.

The Montgomery Fire dive team recovered the body from the submerged vehicle and the remains were taken to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences for an autopsy, said Capt. Saba Coleman.

“This is a sad day our family hoped would not come and there are still many questions that need answers,’’ Stephanie Wheat said in a GoFundMe launched Thursday. Donations to the family for funeral expenses can be made here.

LaDarrien was a 2021 graduate of Lanier High School and hoped to one day become a firefighter. He worked at UPS until a couple of weeks ago, leaving because of the overnight hours.

LaDarrien was driving a 2003 blue Ford Crown Victoria with Alabama license plate DV32851. The vehicle was leaving his girlfriend’s house on Foxhall Drive, which wasn’t far from his home. LaDarrien was also recorded in his vehicle at the Ztec Convenience Store on McGehee Road.

He suffered from heart palpitations and takes two different medications to keep his heart in balance.

“The outpouring and support has been overwhelming and provided our family with the courage and strength needed to continue in our anguish and distraught to find our loved one,’’ his parents wrote. “We did not give up hope of finding him and although the outcome was not what we wanted, He is back where he belongs with family. We are now able to lay him to rest in dignity as a child of God that he and everyone deserves.”

The family thanked the hundreds of people who helped search for LaDarrien.

“All searches brought value and allowed us to narrow and prioritize areas for search,’’ the wrote. “The firefighters and Montgomery police department bought peace and closure of our search and recovery of Ladarrien Wheat that we needed. It was Gods will that Ladarrien was found on yesterday and God’s presence was felt and known through you.”
