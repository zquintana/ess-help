A Shelbyville man assisting a stranded motorist on Hwy. 21 near Chireno was killed Thursday after 

being struck by a passing car.

Texas Department of Public Safety on Friday was still investigating the crash that killed 68-year-

old James Curtis Henry.

Henry had been assisting with a disabled 2014 Jeep SUV in the westbound lane at about 6:25 p.m. 

Thursday, according to a preliminary investigation, when the driver of a 1999 Chevrolet passenger 

car spotted the Jeep and took evasive action to avoid colliding with the Jeep but struck Henry.

The crash happened about a mile west of Chireno.

Both Henry and the driver of the Chevrolet, identified as 20-year-old Jessie Jacobs of Nacogdoches, 

were taken by ambulance to Nacogdoches Memorial Hospital. Henry was pronounced dead at the 

hospital.

The crash is being investigated as the third traffic fatality this year in Nacogdoches County.
