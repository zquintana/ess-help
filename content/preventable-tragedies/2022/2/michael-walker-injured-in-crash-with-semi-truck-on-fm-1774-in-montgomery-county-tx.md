Montgomery County, TX -- December 30, 2021, 55-year-old Michael Walker was seriously injured in a crash with a tractor-trailer on Farm to Market Road 1774 in Montgomery County.

Authorities say the incident happened around 7:00 p.m. on FM 1775 near High Meadow Ranch Road. Preliminary investigation suggests Walker was driving a GMC Sierra pickup truck east on the roadway when he approached a disabled Freightliner semi-tuck with no trailer that was stopped in the road's left lane. Reports say the semi-truck had its emergency flashers activated and cones placed behind it.

Walker allegedly failed to reduce his vehicle's speed when approaching the disabled truck and crashed into the back of it. He suffered serious injuries. The semi-truck driver was not in the vehicle at the time of the crash and wasn't hurt.

No further information is currently available.
