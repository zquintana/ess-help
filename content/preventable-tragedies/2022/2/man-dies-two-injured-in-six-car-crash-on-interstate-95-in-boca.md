A 63-year-old Miami City man is dead following a six-car crash, involving three sedans and two pickup trucks, on south Interstate 95 near Palmetto Park Road in Boca Raton.

According to the Florida Highway Patrol, at about 5:45 p.m. Wednesday, a sedan driven by a 34 year-old Colorado man was traveling south on Interstate 95 in the outside express lane then veered left to the inside express lane, before veering right once again.

The sedan then began to spin clockwise and moved southwest through the express lane delineators, into the inside lane of I-95, then struck the rear of the car driven by the Miami City man.

That led to a chain-reaction crash in which both cars were hit multiple times by three other cars — a sedan and two pickup trucks.

The Miami City man was “partially ejected” through the passenger window of his car on impact, resulting in his death at the crash site. He was not wearing a seatbelt, according to FHP.

The crash report says that the order of additional crashes between the Colorado man’s sedan, and the three vehicles caught up in the chain-reaction crash is still being investigated.

A 40-year-old Boynton Beach man and a 9-year-old passenger were in the third sedan. Both were wearing seatbelts and had only minor injuries.

The pickup trucks were driven by a 40-year-old Boca Raton man and a 57-year-old Pembroke Pines man, respectively. Both were wearing seatbelts and neither was injured, according to FHP.

The name of the man who died has not been released.
