title: "Man who survived crash is hit and killed when he gets out of car, Louisiana cops say"
---
A Louisiana man got out of his vehicle after he survived a minor collision in Metairie. Moments later, he was hit by a third vehicle. Chad James, 49, from Thibodaux, died on the scene, Louisiana State Police said in a news release. Manuel Llorens, 60, was traveling in his car on the right lane of the Interstate 10 near Clearview Parkway. At the same time, two cars were stopped on the right shoulder near the Clearview Parkway exit, west of downtown New Orleans. The drivers of both cars were standing outside their vehicles. One of them was James, troopers say.

As Llorens approached the two cars, he traveled off the roadway to the right and onto the shoulder, eventually hitting the side of James’ vehicle, state troopers said. During the series of collisions that followed, James and the other driver were both hit by Llorens’ vehicle. Troopers said the two men had been involved in a minor collision and were outside their vehicles discussing that incident when the third vehicle hit them.

James was pronounced dead at the scene, according to troopers, and the other man suffered serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital. Llorens was not injured, troopers say. “While it is still unknown if impairment was a factor in this crash,” troopers say they “remind drivers that impaired driving continues to be a major problem throughout Louisiana.” Blood samples were obtained from all the drivers involved, troopers said. In the event of a crash, police remind drivers to “remain in your vehicle, seat belted until law enforcement arrives and secures the scene for safety.” The investigation is ongoing.
