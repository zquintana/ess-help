Robert Sherman of Chesterfield was found dead after he was reported missing Feb. 7, Massachusetts State Police said.

Police said a vehicle he had rented was found stuck in snow in Huntington on Feb. 9 near 230 Norwich Lake Road. He was last seen two days before in Westfield around 9:30 a.m.

“Sadly Robert Sherman was located deceased. Our sympathy and prayers go out to Mr. Sherman’s family and friends,” police said in a Facebook post.

The 79-year-old is being remembered for his “strong Boston accent and a dry sense of humor.” He was also an avid reader and outdoorsman, his step-daughter, Merle O’Neal, posted to Instagram. O’Neal is known for her vegan video series on Buzzfeed.

“Bob was a father to me. He taught me to drive, to ski, to camp. I never would have been the true horse girl I am today without him driving me to and from the barn for 15 years,” she wrote.

She also thanked all those who shared his photo, helped look for him and kept her company.

“Bob, thank you for this one last gift before you had to go. Through this experience I have witnessed true human kindness, it exists out there in those we know and don’t know. It’s important to remember that now more than ever,” she wrote. “I love you, Bob, thank you for your unconditional love, support, and encouragement. I couldn’t have asked for more.”
