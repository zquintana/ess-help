title: "Off-duty Branson fire marshal seriously injured while changing a tire on I-44"

Troopers say a Branson fire marshal was seriously injured over the weekend when a passing car hit him while he was changing a flat tire on his vehicle. 

Fire Marshal Dennis Brunner, of Branson Fire Rescue, was off duty on Saturday when his car got a flat tire at about 7:45 pm on Interstate 44 just east of Springfield. While Brunner was working to change the tire on the shoulder of the highway, a passing motorist heading eastbound driving a 2021 GMC Sierra left his lane and entered the shoulder striking Brunner and a woman, Michelle Vise, 48 of Strafford, who was a passenger in Brunner's vehicle, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.

The crash also caused the spare tire to roll into the roadway where it was struck by a third passing car. 

The patrol says Brunner, 63, suffered serious injuries and was rushed to a hospital. Vise, who was struck by the passenger-side mirror of the truck, suffered minor injuries. 

The driver of the vehicle that struck Brunner and Vise was an 80-year-old man from Ozark who initially left the scene of the crash, according to Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Mike McClure. However, the man did later call to report damage to his vehicle and that he had heard something when he veered into the shoulder.

Neither he nor the driver of the third vehicle was injured in the crash. 

Brunner is expected to make a recovery, according to a news release from the city of Branson. 

“Dennis’ impact on our community, not only the work he does but what he contributes personally, is evident by the amount of calls we have received from concerned citizens and community members,” said Branson Mayor Larry Milton. “He is in our hearts and prayers and we wish him a speedy recovery.” 

The Missouri State Highway Patrol is continuing to investigate the incident, but it is unclear at this time if any criminal charges will be filed, McClure said.
