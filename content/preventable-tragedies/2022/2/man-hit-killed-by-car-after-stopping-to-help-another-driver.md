AUSTIN, Texas - Officials say a Good Samaritan died after he was hit by a car in Northeast Austin. 

Austin-Travis County EMS says medics responded to reports of a single-vehicle crash along East Anderson Lane just east of I-35 at around 4 a.m. on February 20. 

Officials say another driver had pulled over to help, got out of his car, but was struck by oncoming traffic. That person was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the car in the original crash was taken to Dell Seton Medical Center with potentially serious injuries, but they're not expected to be life-threatening. ATCEMS says two other people were involved in the crash but they both refused transport.
