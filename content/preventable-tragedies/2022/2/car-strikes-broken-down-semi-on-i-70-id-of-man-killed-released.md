HARMONY TWP., Clark County — One person died when their car struck a semi that was broken down on Interstate 70.

Michael W. Stevenson, 54, of Westerville, was driving a 2021 Subaru Ascent that hit the right rear corner of a semi that was broken down in the middle lane, according to the Ohio State Highway Patrol. Stevenson’s Subaru then traveled off the right side of the roadway. He was pronounced deceased on the scene.

The driver of the semi, identified as Corey D. Hill, 40, of Marion, sustained minor injuries.

The crash happened around 10:40 a.m. on westbound I-70 west of the state Route 54 exit. Traffic backups on I-70 were reported for hours as crews investigated the crash.

Troopers are investigating whether the semi had any flashing lights or other identifiers that would have alerted the driver who hit the back that the semi was stopped.

A CareFlight medical helicopter was initially requested to be on standby to fly to the scene, however it was later cancelled.
