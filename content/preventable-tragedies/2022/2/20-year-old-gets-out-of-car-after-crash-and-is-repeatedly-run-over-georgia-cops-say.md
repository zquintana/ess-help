title: "20-year-old gets out of car after crash and is repeatedly run over, Georgia cops say"
---
A 20-year-old woman who got out of her car after hitting a wall on a highway near Atlanta died after being repeatedly hit by other vehicles, police said. Shamauri Fluellen, of Austell, hit a center divider wall on Interstate 285 at about 10 p.m. Monday, Feb. 21, Cobb County police said in a news release. A purple 2010 Jeep Wrangler hit her gold 2001 Mercedes-Benz E320 from behind. Fluellen got out of her car and tried to cross to the shoulder but was hit and killed by multiple other vehicles on the highway, police said.

She was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The driver of the Jeep was not hurt. Several of the drivers who hit Fluellen stopped to wait for police, but investigators think the first driver to hit her failed to stop. They ask anyone with information to call 770-499-3987.
