FARGO (KFGO) – The North Dakota Highway Patrol responded to multiple crashes along I-29 and I-94 on Friday, including two that resulted in injuries.

The first injury crash happened just before 9 a.m. on southbound I-29 near the Gardner exit. The NDHP said a 43-year-old male from Fargo lost control of his car, causing it to come to  rest across both southbound lanes. The driver exited his vehicle. 

A 41-year-old male from Forest River, driving a pickup truck, struck the car “in a sideswipe style collision” before a semi-truck, driven by a 26- year-old Fargo male, rear ended the car. The car struck its driver who was standing next to his vehicle. 

The driver of the car sustained serious, non-life threatening injuries and was taken to Sanford Hospital in Fargo. 

The second crash happened on northbound I-29 near Dwight around 9:30 a.m. A 48-year-old male from Hankinson, driving a pickup truck, was involved in a minor collision that caused his vehicle to become disabled in the left northbound lane. 

A northbound SUV, driven by a 40-year-old male from Bixby, rear ended the pickup and also became disabled. The driver of the SUV exited his vehicle. 

The SUV was then hit by a car driven by a 19-year-old male from Jamestown. A 38-year-old female passenger from Glendale AZ in the SUV sustained serious, non-life threatening injuries and was transported to the Breckenridge Hospital. 

The driver of the pickup also sustained serious, non-life threatening injuries and was taken to Sanford Hospital in Fargo. 

Both crashes are still under investigation by the NDHP.
