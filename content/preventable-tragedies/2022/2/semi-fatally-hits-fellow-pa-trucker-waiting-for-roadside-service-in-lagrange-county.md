LAGRANGE COUNTY, Ind. (WANE) – A semi-truck driver died in an overnight crash on the I-80/90 Toll Road near Shipshewana Sunday morning.

Shamshitdin Nuridinov, 45, of Morrisville, PA was hit by another semi that veered off the road and hit his truck.

Indiana State Police got to the scene at the toll road’s westbound 114 mile-marker and found two semis. One was parked on the shoulder with cautionary triangles, and another had crashed in the nearby ditch.

Troopers found Nuridinov severely injured and unresponsive in the ditch. They tried life-saving measures, but Nuridinov was pronounced dead at the scene.

The investigation revealed Nuridinov was driving a 2019 Volvo semi that police said had run out of gas, so he pulled over on the shoulder. He got out of the truck and police said he stood well off the road in the side ditch to call his trucking company dispatcher.

That’s when Joseph Jett, 35, of Ambridge, PA, drove a white 2022 Freightliner across the road’s white fog line. Police said Jett’s truck hit the back of Nuridinov’s truck, side-swiped the cab, veered off the road and then crashed through the guard rail, running over Nuridinov and finally coming to a stop when it hit a concrete wall.

The investigation found both semis were significantly damaged and towed away for inspection. Traffic in the area could only flow through one lane for about four hours while the crash debris was cleaned up.

This is an ongoing investigation.
