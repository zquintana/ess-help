VOLUSIA COUNTY, Fla. —

9 a.m. Update:

Troopers have released new details about a deadly crash on I-95 near Ormond Beach.

Investigators said a pedestrian was struck and killed by a tractor trailer truck along the interstate early Tuesday.

According to an incident report, a man driving southbound on I-95 crashed his 2003 Pontiac sedan into the center guardrail.
