(WXYZ) â€” Michigan State Police tweeted a synopsis of multiple crashes that happened Sunday afternoon as snow moved through the area.

According to MSP, on eastbound I-96 near Grand River, a driver got out of his vehicle to inspect the damage on his car after he was involved in an earlier crash. Another driver reportedly could not stop and struck the vehicle. MSP said that the pedestrian was pushed into a highway wall barrier by his vehicle.

The pedestrian was transported to a local hospital with critical head injuries, police say.

On I-696 EB near Halsted, MSP says there were up to 70 cars involved in crashes. Another area, WB I-696 and Middlebelt had up to 30 vehicles involved in crashes, and on WB I-696 near Hoover, around 60 vehicles reportedly were involved in crashes.

And the incidents didn't end there. Other crash scenes were reported across metro Detroit, too, Sunday afternoon:
