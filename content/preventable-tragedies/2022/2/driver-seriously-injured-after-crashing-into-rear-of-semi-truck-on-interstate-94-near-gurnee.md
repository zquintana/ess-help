A woman suffered serious injuries but is expected to survive after she crashed into the rear of a stopped semi-truck on Interstate 94 near Wadsworth.

The Illinois State Police, Newport Fire Protection District and Gurnee Fire Department responded around 4:49 p.m. Sunday to Interstate 94 north of Wadsworth Road for a vehicle crash.

An Illinois State Police spokesperson said District 15 units found a semi-truck and a car involved in a crash in the westbound lanes of Interstate 94 near mile marker 3.5.

The driver of the semi-truck reported that he was stopped on the right shoulder when an SUV crashed into the rear of his vehicle, according to police radio communications.

A woman was trapped inside the SUV and state troopers initially believed she suffered life-threatening injuries.

She was transported by ambulance to Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville.

The state police spokesperson said the victimâ€™s injuries ended up not being life-threatening.

The two right lanes of westbound Interstate 94 were closed for a crash investigation immediately following the incident.

All lanes were reopened approximately three hours later at 8 p.m., state police said.
