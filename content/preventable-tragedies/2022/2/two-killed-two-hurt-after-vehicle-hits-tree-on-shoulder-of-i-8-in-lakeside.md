LAKESIDE  â€” Two people were killed and two were injured early Saturday when a car went off Interstate 8 in Lakeside and struck a tree on the right shoulder of the freeway, officials said.
The driver, 44-year-old man, was heading west on I-8 east of Lake Jennings Park Road when for an unknown reason the 2005 Toyota Camry Solara veered off the road and struck the tree, the California Highway Patrol said. After hitting the tree, the vehicle rolled and came to rest on its left side, officials said.

Investigators believe the solo-vehicle crash occurred around 2 a.m.

A 46-year-old passenger got out and walked away, apparently looking for help. He was found about a mile west of the crash site around 3 a.m.

CHP officers and Lakeside Fire Department personnel assisted the man, who claimed he had been assaulted and not involved in a crash. However, an investigation showed that was untrue, the CHP said. The man was transported to a hospital to be treated for injuries.

CHP officers searched the area for a crash site but were unable to locate a vehicle that had crashed. More than three hours later, when there was more light, the CHP received calls from drivers around 6:15 a.m. who saw the wrecked car on the west side of I-8.

The driver and a 51-year-old female passenger died before they could be taken to a hospital. Their names have not been released. Another passenger, a 49-year-old man, was extricated from the wreck and transported to the hospital with major injuries, the CHP said.

Anyone who witnessed the crash was asked to contact the El Cajon CHP office at (619) 401-2000 to talk with investigators.
