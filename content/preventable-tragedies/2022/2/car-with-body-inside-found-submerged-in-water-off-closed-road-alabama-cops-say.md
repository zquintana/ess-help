title: "Car with body inside found submerged in water off closed road, Alabama cops say"
---
After a car veered off the road and plunged into waters in Alabama, police were called to pull it out. They said they found a body inside. The incident was reported around 9:30 p.m. on Feb. 13, Huntsville police told WHNT, but officials believed the crash could have happened hours before officers were called out. The body inside was identified as James Michael Rusiniak, 62, who had been driving the vehicle along a section of Hobbs Island Road that was shut down for repairs, Huntsville police told WAAY. He died as a result of the crash, the outlet reported.

Wooden and concrete barriers were blocking the road to prevent cars from driving through it, but officers told AL.com that they believe Rusiniak had driven past the barricades and hit the concrete blockade, causing him to veer into the water. A reporter from WAAY recorded footage of police pulling the red sports car out of the water on Feb. 13, with the hood noticeably crushed.

Police told media outlets that an investigation into the crash is underway. McClatchy News reached out to the Huntsville Police Department for more information and did not receive an immediate response.
