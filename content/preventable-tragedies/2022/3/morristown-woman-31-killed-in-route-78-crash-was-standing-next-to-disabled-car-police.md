A 31-year-old Morristown woman died and a 42-year-old man was injured after being struck by a car while standing on the side of the highway following a previous crash on Route 78 Tuesday, March 29, authorities said.

Amy L. Miller and Balele J. Bamoun were standing alongside a Toyota Camry that was disabled in the left lanes of the express lanes near milepost 53.2 in Union Township around 8:20 p.m., New Jersey State Police Trooper Charles Marchan said.

A passing Nissan struck by a Honda was sent into the concrete barrier and Miller, then the back of the Toyota, Marchan said. The Toyota then hit Bamoun on impact, Marchan said. Miller died as a result of the crash. 

The crash remains under investigation and there was no additional information available as of Wednesday afternoon.
