SAN JOSE, CA â€” A 62-year-old man died Thursday night after a multiple-vehicle collision on I-280 in San Jose, according to the California Highway Patrol. CHP issued a Sig-alert, and blocked all northbound lanes of I-280 as well as the off-ramp overnight.

The crash was reported at about 11:17 p.m. Thursday on the Saratoga Avenue off-ramp to I-280. CHP Officer Ross Lee told the Mercury News that a 62-year-old Santa Clara man made an "unsafe" turn from the northbound lanes onto the off-ramp, and collided with a Tesla. The Tesla ended up in the east shoulder of the off-ramp, while the original driver lost control of the wheel, and overturned in the middle of the freeway.

Lee told the Mercury News that the driver was hit by three other cars, and pronounced dead shortly after. No other injuries were reported.

All I-280 lanes have reopened as of Friday morning, according to sigalert.com.
