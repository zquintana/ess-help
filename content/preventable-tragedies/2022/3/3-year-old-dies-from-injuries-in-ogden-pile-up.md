OGDEN â€” A 3-year-old girl has died from her injuries after a crash that temporarily closed the freeway Wednesday morning.

Just before 5 a.m., a series of pile-up crashes happened on Interstate 15 northbound, near 21st Street, in Ogden. The crashes included nine or 10 vehicles that caused multiple injuries and blocked traffic lanes.

In one of the more serious crashes, a Hyundai passenger car lost control to the left, hit the center concrete barrier and came to rest facing the wrong way, Utah Highway Patrol troopers said. A PT Cruiser then overcorrected to avoid the Hyundai, but hit the center barrier and came to rest sideways, blocking traffic.

Other vehicles were unable to avoid the stopped vehicles. A 3-year-old girl in the PT Cruiser was taken to a local hospital with critical injuries, along with one adult who also sustained serious injuries but did not appear to be life-threatening, troopers said.

I-15 northbound remained closed until about 7 a.m. The crash was one of about 50 that occurred by noon on Wednesday, most of which were weather-related, UHP Sgt. Cameron Roden confirmed.
