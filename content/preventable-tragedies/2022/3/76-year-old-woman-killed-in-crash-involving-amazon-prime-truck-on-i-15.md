A 76-year-old woman was killed overnight after the SUV she was traveling in crashed into a big rig that jackknifed on a rainslicked Interstate 15 near Normal Heights.

An Amazon semi-trailer slid sideways to a halt around 2:20 a.m. Friday while traveling on I-15 north amid slippery conditions from an overnight storm. Shortly after, an SUV crashed into the semi-truck, wedging itself stuck under the large vehicle.

Paramedics took the motorist to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead, CHP public affairs Officer Salvador Castro said. Her name was withheld pending family notification.

CHP dispatchers said as a result of the crash, diesel began to spill onto the freeway. First responders decided to shut down all lanes of I-15 north near Adams Avenue for cleanup and its investigation.

The fatal wreck left all northbound lanes of SR-15 block in the area

for about three and a half hours before lanes were reopened at about 6:30 a.m.

The trucker, a 27-year-old San Bernardino County man, was unhurt, Castro said.
