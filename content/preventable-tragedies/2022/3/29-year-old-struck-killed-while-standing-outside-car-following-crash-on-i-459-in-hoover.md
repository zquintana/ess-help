A 29-year-old man was killed when he was hit by a vehicle while standing outside of his car on Interstate 459 in Hoover.

Just before 11 p.m. Saturday, Hoover 911 received a call of a traffic crash involving a passenger car and a tractor-trailer on I-459 southbound, said Capt. Keith Czeskleba.

The car was stopped in the travel lane as a result of that crash and the driver was standing outside of his vehicle when another vehicle hit him.

The man was taken to UAB Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 12:53 a.m. Sunday. His name is being withheld pending notification of his family.

Czeskleba said the driver of the vehicle that struck the victim remained on the scene.

The investigation is ongoing.
