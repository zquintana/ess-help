title: "Rogelio Sanchez Injured in Chain-Reaction Crash on I-14 in Belton, TX"
---
Belton, TX -- January 30, 2022, 22-year-old Rogelio Sanchez was injured in a multi-vehicle accident on Interstate 14 in Bell County.

Authorities say the incident happened around 2:10 a.m. on I-14 near mile marker 297. Preliminary investigation suggests a Dodge Ram 1500 pickup was headed east on the road followed at a short distance by Sanchez's Chevy Avalanche, then a Dodge Avenger, a Nissan Sentra, and a Nissan Kicks.

Reports say the Ram driver veered into the outside guardrail and then swerved back left, hitting the concrete barrier wall. After the second impact it became completely disabled at the crest of a hill, stopped in the road with its lights out.

Moments later Sanchez crashed into the disabled Dodge with enough force that the pickup's cargo flew out of its bed and over the barrier wall. The Avenger soon followed, crashing into Sanchez's Avalanche and spinning it around 180 degrees. The Sentra then hit the Avalanche again, followed by the Kicks. The Kicks also hit the Sentra before coming to rest.

Sanchez suffered serious injuries in the accident. No other injuries were reported.

No further information is currently available.
