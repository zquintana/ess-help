title: "Julie Ann Burroughs Injured in 18-wheeler Accident in Hunt County, TX"
---
Hunt County, TX -- February 24, 2022, Julie Ann Burroughs was injured following an accident where multiple trucks crashed on the icy freeway.

Investigators reported that the series of events took place at approximately 7:45 a.m. along I-30 near mile marker 99.

Officials said that the roads were icy at the time of the crash. Apparently, a previous crash occurred, leaving a Ford Mustang stationary in the lanes of travel. Reports said that the driver of that vehicle, identified as 58-year-old Julie Ann Burroughs, was outside the vehicle nearby. An 18-wheeler approaching the scene slowed to a stop, but another semi-trailer did not slow down in time. That semi swerved into the other truck, then jackknifed. It hit the Mustang, also hitting Burroughs in the process.

After the accident, reports reflected that Burroughs reportedly sustained incapacitating injuries. It appears there were no other injuries, according to reports. Right now, additional details about the accident are unavailable.
