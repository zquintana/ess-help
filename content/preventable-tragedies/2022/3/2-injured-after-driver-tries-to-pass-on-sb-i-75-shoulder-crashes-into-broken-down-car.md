MIAMI TWP. — Two people were hurt, including one person with serious injuries, after a crash on southbound I-75 between West Carrollton and Miamisburg Wednesday morning, according to state troopers.

The crash happened around 6:40 a.m. between the East Dixie Drive and state Route 725 exits. A purple Ford Focus, driven by Donnie Wilson, 31, of Dayton was traveling south behind a truck that was driving slower when he tried to pass the truck on the right shoulder, state troopers said in a media release.

The Ford then crashed into the back of a red Chevy Malibu, driven by Susan Henne, 66, of Piqua, that was broken-down and parked on the right shoulder. The crash sent Henne’s car into the truck and trailer Wilson had been attempting to pass.

Henne suffered serious injuries and was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment. Wilson attempted to run from the scene but didn’t make it far because of a leg injury he suffered in the crash, state troopers said.

Wilson was taken to Kettering Health Miamisburg for treatment of non-life threatening injuries. State troopers did not indicate if Wilson was facing any charges or citations in the incident.

The driver of the truck, identified as Paul Loschi, 65, of Englewood, was not injured.

The crash caused the highway to be shut down for about 90 minutes until the left lane was reopened around 7:50 a.m. All lanes of the highway were reopened around 9 a.m.

We’ll continue to update this story as we learn more.
