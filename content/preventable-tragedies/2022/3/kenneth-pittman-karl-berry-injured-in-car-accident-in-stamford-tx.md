Stamford, TX -- February 14, 2022, Kenneth Pittman and Karl Berry were injured due to an accident where their vehicles collided.

Investigators reported that the crash took place at around 6:12 a.m. along US 277 just off Gould Street.

Officials said that 42-year-old Karly Berry was driving a Chevy Tahoe while 51-year-old Kenneth Pittman was the driver of a Dodge Ram 1500. In the initial reports, it appeared that the Tahoe drifted onto the median, then went back onto the highway and overturned. After the vehicle overturned, some time later, the Dodge hit the Chevy.

Berry reportedly had incapacitating injuries due to the crash while reports say Pittman had non-incapacitating injuries. No further information about the crash has been confirmed at this time.
