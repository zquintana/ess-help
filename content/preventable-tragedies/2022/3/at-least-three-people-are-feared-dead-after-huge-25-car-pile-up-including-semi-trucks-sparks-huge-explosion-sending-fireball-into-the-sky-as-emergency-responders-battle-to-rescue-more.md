At least three people have died and others including a child have been airlifted to hospital after a huge 25-car pile-up including semi-trucks sparked a huge explosion on the I-95 in Volusia County in Florida. 

State troopers said that there were five crashes involving 25 vehicles on both sides of the highway near the State Road 442 exit in Edgewater. 

Footage shows a massive fireball rocketing into the sky after a truck caught fire and exploded, according to WFTV. 

It is believed the crashes happened after a recent controlled burn of nearby forest led to fog and smoke, reducing visibility to almost zero. 

It is unclear if any others have been pronounced dead or the severity of injuries of those airlifted to hospital. 

One child was airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando, and an unknown number of victims were taken to Halifax Health in Daytona.  

All northbound and southbound lanes are closed from State Road 44 to Deering Parkway and the closures are expected to last into the afternoon.
