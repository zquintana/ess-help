title: "Update: I-84 reopens 6 hours after fatal crash forced 50-mile closure in Oregon"
---
Eastbound lanes of Interstate 84 in Oregon reopened more than six hours after a fatal crash about six miles west of La Grande on Wednesday closed the roadway. The closure, announced at 9:45 a.m., covered about 50 miles from just east of Pendleton to near La Grande. The crash required a police investigation, which meant a lengthy closure, the Oregon Department of Transportation said.

A Mercedes driven by Brian Burton, 59, of Portland, was stopped in an eastbound lane at 8:50 a.m. because of an earlier crash, when it was hit by a semi truck driven by Eddi Morales, 30, of Othello. The eastbound Freightliner came around a curve and was unable to stop, hitting the left side of the Mercedes, according to the Oregon State Police.

Burton died before he could be taken to a hospital. Helen Burton, 62, of Portland, a passenger in the Mercedes and Morales were not injured, according to OSP. Speed and an icy roadway are being investigated as contributing factors to the crash, said the OSP. ODOT crews worked Wednesday morning to get a long line of traffic stuck behind the crash turned around and sent back to Pendleton. Westbound lanes remained open.
