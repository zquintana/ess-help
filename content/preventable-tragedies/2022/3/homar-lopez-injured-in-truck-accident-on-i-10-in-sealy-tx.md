title: "Homar Lopez Injured in Truck Accident on I-10 in Sealy, TX"
---
Sealy, TX -- February 28, 2022, 43-year-old Homar Lopez was seriously injured in a collision with a commercial truck on Interstate 10 in Austin County.

Authorities say the incident happened around 2:25 p.m. on I-10 near mile marker 718. Preliminary investigation suggests Lopez was driving a GMC Sierra pickup truck west when the vehicle became disabled and came to a stop near mile marker 718. Behind the Sierra, a Mack Terrapro truck approached from the east. The truck rounded a curve in the road and the driver reportedly couldn't see the pickup stopped ahead; the pickup's taillights were active but the brake lights were not on at the time.

The Mack truck crashed into the rear of the pickup, pushing it forward approximately 300 feet and partially ejecting Lopez out the back of the vehicle.

Lopez received serious injuries in the crash. The Mack driver reportedly received minor injuries.

No further information is currently available.
