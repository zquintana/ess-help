SOMERS — A 65-year-old man from Racine was struck and killed Saturday night while attempting to walk across the interestate from his disabled vehicle.

According to the Wisconsin State Patrol, Emanuel Wilson Jr. died at the scene of the accident, on I-41/I-94 at Highway KR in Kenosha County near Somers, at approximately 10.30 p.m.

The department indicated that he exited a disabled vehicle parked on the right shoulder of I-41/94 southbound and began walking across traffic lanes near the vehicle. He was truck by multiple vehicles resulting in fatal injuries

Assisting agencies included units with the Kenosha County Sheriff’s Department, Racing County Sheriff’s Department, Somers Fire and Rescue and Kenosha County Medical Examiner’s Office.
