WAYNE COUNTY (WWJ) - A 21-year-old man who was crossing I-94 after being involved in a hit-and-run accident has died of his injuries after he was struck by another vehicle early Friday morning.

The Michigan State Police released the update Saturday morning; the latest announcement is the second fatal crash in two nights involving a person who was hit while trying to cross a freeway.

MSP said the victim was initially involved in a two- vehicle crash on westbound I-94 near Harper on Detroit's eastside just after midnight on Friday. The driver of the second vehicle took off, leaving the victim's car blocking the center lane.

The victim got out of his vehicle and tried to cross the freeway when he was hit by another car.

Troopers responding to the crash said the force of the impact caused the victim, now pedestrian, to go over the median wall and land in the left lane of eastbound I-94.

The driver who hit the victim stopped and was questioned by police.

Troopers closed all lanes in both directions on I-94 while they conducted an investigation; MSP said they are looking for the driver involved in the first hit-and-run accident.

Anyone with information or witnesses to the first crash are being asked to call 734-287-5000.
