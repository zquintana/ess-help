Hopkins County, TX -- March 9, 2022, 29-year-old Fadi Kathawa was killed in a collision between two 18-wheelers on Interstate 30 in Hopkins County.

Authorities say the incident happened around 11:00 p.m. on I-30 near U.S. Highway 67, roughly seven miles east of Sulphur Springs. Preliminary investigation suggests Kathawa was driving a Freightliner tractor-trailer east on the roadway when he lost control for unknown reasons. The truck veered out of its lane and hit a guardrail. It then rolled over across the eastbound lanes close to an overpass, after which it was struck by an International 18-wheeler. The impact reportedly split the Freightliner in two.

Kathawa was ejected during the crash and was pronounced dead at the scene. The International truck driver, 33-year-old Lester Brown, was treated and released.

No further information is currently available.
