title: "Luis Geraldo Rivera Killed in 18-wheeler Accident in Culberson County, TX"
---
Culberson County, TX -- February 3, 2022, Luis Geraldo Rivera was killed due to an accident involving two 18-wheelers on the interstate.

Initial reports from authorities said that the crash took place at around 8:14 a.m. along I-10 near mile marker 158.

According to officials, a previous incident occurred involving an 18-wheeler which left it disabled on the highway and on fire. The fire was put out, but reportedly reignited hours later. The smoke created issues with visibility for approaching traffic, reports say.

In the smokey conditions, authorities say that a vehicle driven by 27-year-old Luis Geraldo Rivera crashed into the burning tractor-trailer. Following this, another 18-wheeler crashed into Rivera and the other 18-wheeler.

Rivera sustained fatal injuries due to the crash. No further information about the accident is available at this time.
