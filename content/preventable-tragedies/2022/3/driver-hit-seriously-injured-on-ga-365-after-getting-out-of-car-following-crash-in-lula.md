A driver suffered serious injuries after being hit by a car on GA 365 in Hall County. The crash happened around 10:41 p.m. Thursday, March 10, at the intersection of Lula Road,

According to Georgia State Patrol spokesperson Mark Riley, the driver was following too closely and rear-ended another vehicle in the north right lane of the highway. His car wound up blocking both northbound lanes with no lights on "causing it to be very hard to see the vehicle at night," Riley says.

After the crash, the at-fault driver got out of his vehicle and was in the roadway when another vehicle hit him. 

EMS transported the seriously injured driver to Northeast Georgia Medical Center in Gainesville for treatment. GSP has not released his name nor information on whether any charges are pending.

The accident temporarily shut down the northbound lanes of GA 365 in Lula.
