A man was struck and killed on the 210 Freeway early Sunday morning, March 6, while changing a tire on the side of the roadway, the California Highway Patrol said Monday, March 7.

At about 2:35 a.m., the driver of a Honda was standing on the right shoulder of the east 210 Freeway east of Ayala Drive to change his car’s tire, the CHP said in a news release. A man driving a Ford Econoline was traveling the same direction when the Ford veered right and struck the pedestrian, authorities said.

The Honda driver died from his injuries at the scene, the CHP said. The Ford driver stayed at the scene.

No identifying information for the victim was immediately available.

Alcohol or drugs were not believed to be a factor in the crash, authorities said.

“As a reminder, please pull over to a safe location if you have a flat tire,” the CHP release said. “If possible, try to exit the freeway if there is an exit near.”

Anyone with information regarding the collision is encouraged to contact Officer M. Eshleman at the CHP at 909-383-4247.
