TAMPA, Fla. â€” Troopers say a man was hit and killed by a car early Saturday morning on Interstate 75 in Hillsborough County.

It happened just after 5:30 a.m. in the outside lane of I-75 southbound near exit 257 in Brandon, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

FHP says a man driving a Fiat sedan collided into the back of a tractor-trailer which was driving in front of him. Both vehicles came to a rest on the outside shoulder.

Troopers say the Fiat driver got out of his car and attempted to walk across the highway. He walked into the path of a Toyota SUV and was hit and killed, according to FHP.

The driver and two passengers in the SUV suffered minor injuries.
