A man riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle was critically injured in a crash Friday morning on U.S. 301 in Sumter County.

The 49-year-old Sumterville man had been riding the 2015 Harley-Davidson at 6:40 a.m. southbound on U.S. 301 approaching East Belt Avenue north of Bushnell when a 50-year-old Bushnell woman driving a 2017 Chevrolet Colorado traveling in the opposite direction made a left turn into his path, according to an accident report from the Florida Highway Patrol.

The motorcyclist, who was not wearing a helmet, was ejected from the motorcycle in the collision. The woman got out of the pickup in an attempt to come to the aid of the injured motorcyclist, but she was hit by a 2002 GMC Envoy which also hit the motorcycle. The GMC Envoy was driven by a 62-year-old Summerfield man. He escaped injury, but his 88-year-old female passenger was critically injured.
