Sussex County, VA -- March 21, 2022, Dennis Abington was killed in a collision with two tractor-trailers on Interstate 95 in Sussex County.

Authorities say the incident happened around 4:05 a.m. on southbound I-95 near mile marker 29. Preliminary investigation suggests Abington was driving a Nissan Sentra south on the roadway when he collided for unknown reasons with a Kenworth tractor-trailer. After the impact the Kenworth pulled onto the shoulder but the Nissan remained in the travel lanes, and soon after it was struck by a southbound Peterbilt 18-wheeler. The second crash pushed the Nissan onto the shoulder; the Peterbilt crossed through the median into the northbound lanes and jackknifed before coming to a stop.

Abington was pronounced dead at the scene. The Peterbilt driver reported minor injuries and the Kenworth driver was unhurt.

Police say neither speed or impairment were factors and everyone was wearing seat belts.

No further information is currently available.
