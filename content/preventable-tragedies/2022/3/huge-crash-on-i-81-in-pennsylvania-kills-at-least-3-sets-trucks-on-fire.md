title: "Huge Crash on I-81 in Pennsylvania Kills at Least 3, Sets Trucks on Fire"
---
A car crash involving over a dozen vehicles on a Pennsylvania highway amidst a brutal snow squall closed all lanes, with reports of people trapped, dozens of injuries and at least three deaths.

The crash occurred before 11 a.m. Monday morning on I-81 northbound between Minersville and Highridge Park Road, with an estimated 50 to 60 vehicles involved. Officials said several semi-trucks were on fire and that there were at least two vehicles with people trapped inside.

At least 20 people were injured and have been transported to local hospitals thus far. It's unknown what their conditions are at this time. Schuylkill County coroner Dr. David J. Moylan told the Associated Press there are at least three confirmed deaths, but suspected "it could run higher."

Authorities called the crash a "mass casualty incident" which is defined as "an event that overwhelms the local healthcare system, where the number of casualties vastly exceeds the local resources and capabilities in a short period of time."

Boswell Fire Department posted on Facebook that there were numerous people trapped in cars and possible critical patients but didn't provide any additional details.

The Red Cross is helping others who were at the scene at a reception center by connecting them with their families, John Blickley with the Schuylkill County Office of Emergency Management told Newsweek.

Videos of the scene posted on social media showed heavy amounts of snow and low visibility. The footage showed several semi-trucks running into other vehicles and SUVs driving off the road. One SUV was seen driving down the highway at high speeds with its hazard lights on before crashing into at least three other vehicles. Individuals ran into the nearby trees to get away from the road.

Trooper David Beohm with the Pennsylvania State Police told Newsweek Monday afternoon that there were multiple semi-trailers on fire and the fire department estimated it will be another two hours before they're put out.

Authorities are searching vehicles to check if people are trapped inside and marking them with a red X to indicate that it's clear. Local journalist Matt Catrillo reported on Twitter that all of the extractions have been completed except for one.

Meanwhile, additional heavy squalls are expected within the hour. A snow squall is a sudden snowfall with whiteout conditions, gusty winds, and falling temperatures which creates icy roads within just a few minutes.

"There is no safe place on a highway during a snow squall," according to the National Weather Service (NWS).

The NWS issued several warnings for snow squalls in Pennsylvania earlier Monday. On Twitter, the agency advised that if drivers find themselves in a squall to slow down, avoid slamming on the breaks and turn the hazard lights on.

Dr. Mehmet Oz, who is running for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, posted on Twitter saying he is "closely monitoring the situation along I-81 in Schuylkill County. Thank you to all the first responders on the scene."

Newsweek reached out to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Schuylkill County Coroner's Office for comment.
