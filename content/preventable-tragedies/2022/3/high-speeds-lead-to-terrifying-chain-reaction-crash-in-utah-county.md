PLEASANT GROVE, Utah — A single crash in Utah County spiraled into three Sunday morning, narrowly missing responding firefighters who were trying to help a young child.

Sgt. Chris Bishop with the Utah Highway Patrol said he was called into work because of several crashes on Interstate 15 in the snowy conditions.

He explained that a woman and her fiancé lost control south of the Pleasant Grove Boulevard exit, and their car hit the jersey barrier next to the far-right lane. Her parents happened to also be driving on the freeway and saw it happen.

“Her parents were close behind them, so they stopped to offer assistance. Another car came in, lost control, struck the rear of that minivan that her parents were in,” Bishop recounted.
