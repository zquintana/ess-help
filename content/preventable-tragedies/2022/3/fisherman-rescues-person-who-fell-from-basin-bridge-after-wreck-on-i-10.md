title: "Fisherman rescues person who fell from Basin Bridge after wreck on I-10"

RAMAH - A man who plummeted into Whiskey Bay after a wreck on I-10 was pulled from the water by a person who happened to be fishing nearby.

Emergency responders said the man fell from the Atchafalaya Basin Bridge after another vehicle rammed into a car stopped on the shoulder of the interstate. The crash was first reported around 10:30 a.m. Friday.

"The vehicle stalled, the driver did get out of the vehicle," Major Monty Migliacion with the Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office said. "He popped his hood, and at that time, another vehicle, normal travel eastbound at the 129, struck the rear of this stopped vehicle in the roadway."

With the force of the collision, the man was thrown into the water.

"They had a passenger in that stalled vehicle [who] sustained serious injuries. The guy that went into the water sustained serious injuries," Migliacion said.

Migliacion told WBRZ that the driver who hit the stalled car was also injured in the crash.

A passerby captured video moments after the wreck showing people tossing what appeared to be a rope into the water in an effort to save the man. 

The Iberville Sheriff's Office said a person fishing near the bridge pulled the victim out of the water and helped get him to paramedics.

The eastbound side of the bridge was closed for about two hours as rescue efforts unfolded and to make way for an Airmed helicopter, which landed on the interstate.
