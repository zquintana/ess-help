title: "Benbrook mother, 3-year-old son hit, killed by vehicle as they left their disabled car"
---
A Benbrook woman and her 3-year-old son were killed late Monday when they were hit by a car as they tried to move away from their disabled vehicle, which was in the middle of a Mesquite roadway, Mesquite police said. It was the fifth fatality crash so far this year in Mesquite, leaving seven people dead in 2022 compared with two fatality crashes for the same period in 2021 with two deaths. Mesquite police identified the mother as Jennifer Young, 30, of Benbrook. Her 3-year-old son, who authorities did not identify, also was killed.

The fatal crash was reported just after 11 p.m. Monday in the 17,700 block of westbound Interstate 20 in Mesquite.

A 2006 BMW 325 and a 2014 Nissan Sentra collided, leaving both vehicles disabled. The Sentra was left tangled in a steel cable barrier, while the BMW came to rest in the middle of the highway, Mesquite police said. Young and her son got out of the BMW and attempted to flee to a safe location because another vehicle was approaching the scene, police said. The approaching vehicle, a 2011 Nissan Altima, was not able to stop, and hit Young, her son and the BMW. A 2019 Freightliner towing a trailer also collided with the BMW. Young and her son were pronounced dead at the scene.

The drivers of the other vehicles involved in the crash were not injured.
