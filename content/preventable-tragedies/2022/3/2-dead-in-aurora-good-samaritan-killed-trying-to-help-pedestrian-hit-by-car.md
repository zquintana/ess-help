AURORA, Colo. (CBS4) â€” Aurora police released new information about a crash which left a pedestrian dead on Friday night. The pedestrian was crossing East Colfax Avenue, not using a crosswalk, police say.

The pedestrian was hit by a Mitsubishi sedan heading west, and the driver immediately stopped to help the victim, police say. That driver was subsequently hit by another vehicle described as a Mercury Mountaineer. The second vehicle also heading west.

It happened at Uvalda Street around 8 p.m. Friday.

The driver of the Mercury also pulled over and tried to help the victims. The pedestrian died at the scene, and the driver of the Mitsubishi died at the hospital.
