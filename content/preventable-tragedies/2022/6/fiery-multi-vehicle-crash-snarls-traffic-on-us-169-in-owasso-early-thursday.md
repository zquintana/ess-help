title: "Fiery, multi-vehicle crash snarls traffic on U.S. 169 in Owasso early Thursday"

A fiery crash involving at least three vehicles caused traffic to back up heading into Owasso early Thursday.

The collision occurred around 6:30 a.m. near 76th Street North in the northbound lanes of U.S. 169, where emergency crews responded to reports of a multiple-vehicle accident, according to an Owasso police report.

It states that seven people, including three children, were involved in the crash, and that six were taken to hospitals.

The preliminary investigation indicates that a Saturn Vue traveling south on U.S. 169 veered across the grass median just south of the 86th Street North overpass and struck a northbound Hyundai Sonata.

The Saturn sent the Hyundai into the median, then flipped and burst into flames, coming to rest in the middle of the highway. Another vehicle, a Jeep Wrangler, was northbound when it struck the overturned Saturn, sending the Jeep into the southbound lanes, where it struck a wall.

Owasso firefighters, with the help of nearby motorists, were able to extinguish the flames and pull the occupants from the mangled vehicles.

The driver of the Saturn was transported to an area hospital in serious condition. The driver of the Hyundai had minor injuries, officials said.

The Wrangler was carrying five occupants, one of whom required the jaws of life to extract her. She was sent to an area hospital with serious injuries that were not life-threatening, and the other adult occupant and three children were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries.

What caused the Saturn to cross the median is under investigation.

The southbound lanes of U.S. 169 were closed for about an hour after the crash; northbound lanes were closed for about 1Â½ hours while crews worked to clear the scene.
