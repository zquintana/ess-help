LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - One person is dead after a crash on US-127 north on Wednesday morning, the Ingham County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to News 10.

Just after 9 a.m., Ingham County Central Dispatch received a 911 call about a two-car accident at the interchange of US-127 and I-96. The Ingham County Sheriff’s Office (ICSO) said a vehicle traveling northbound lost control just south of I-96, running off the road and crashing into an unoccupied disabled vehicle on the roadside.

“The driver, a 20-year-old Mason woman, was pronounced dead at the scene,” ICSO said in a release. “A second occupant of her vehicle was transported to a local hospital where he is being treated for serious but non-life threatening injuries.”

The highway was shut down for several hours, opening again at 12 p.m.

ICSO said, “The crash is being investigated by the Ingham Regional Crash Investigation Team. Anyone with any information regarding this incident can contact the Sheriff’s Office.”
