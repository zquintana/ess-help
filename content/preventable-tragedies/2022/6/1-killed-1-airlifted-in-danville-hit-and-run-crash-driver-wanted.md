DANVILLE, Va. (WSET) â€” One person was killed, and another seriously injured, in a crash Wednesday night in Danville.

Pittsylvania County Sheriff Mike Taylor said the incident happened on Highway 58, in the 2400 block of South Boston Road, around 9:20.

Sheriff Taylor said there was one fatality and one person airlifted to the hospital.

Virginia State Police Thursday afternoon said a 2004 Honda CRV became disabled on the side of Route 58. A 33-year-old Ringgold woman and Lenise K. Snead, of Danville, were pushing the CRV when they were struck from behind by a 2021 Honda Accord.

Both vehicles ended up off the right side of the highway.

Troopers say the driver of the Honda Accord fled the scene on foot.

The 33-year-old Ringgold woman was taken to the hospital with serious injuries; she hasn't been identified.

Snead died at the scene, troopers say.

If you have any information on the identity or whereabouts of the driver of the Honda Accord, you're asked to call 540-380-5700.
