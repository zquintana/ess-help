NORTHBROOK, IL â€” Northbrook police posted on social media at 4:59 p.m. Tuesday that Dundee Road (Interstate 294 overpass) is closed from Sanders Road to Portwine Road. Police are advising commuters to find an alternate route.

A scanner report said a driver struck two pedestrians, who were changing a tire, at the Tri-State Tollway. Illinois State Police told Patch the agency "isn't aware or handling any incidents involving pedestrians being hit by a car at Dundee Road and the Tri-State Tollway in Northbrook."

Northbrook police told Patch Wednesday that they had no further information on the accident, as it fell under the Wheeling Police Department's jurisdiction.
