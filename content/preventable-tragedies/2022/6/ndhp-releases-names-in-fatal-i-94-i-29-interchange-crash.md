FARGO (KFGO) â€“ The North Dakota Highway Patrol has released additional names in the Wednesday crash that left one man dead, another injured, and a third under arrest.

The crash happened on the I-29 northbound exit ramp from I-94 during the afternoon rush hour.

50-year-old Don Keplin of Fargo was driving an SUV which was pulling a dolly trailer carrying a car. The trailer had an issue and Keplin pulled over on the shoulder of the off-ramp to check it. Keplin and his passenger, 39-year-old Lucas Azure, also of Fargo, were standing behind the SUV when another car rear-ended the trailer and pushed it forward, causing it to strike the two men.

Keplin and Azure were taken to a local hospital with serious injuries where Azure died.

The driver of the car that caused the collision, 41-year-old Shandi Cordner, of Clitherall, Minnesota, was not injured. He was arrested for felony possession of methamphetamine. Additional charges are pending.
