A driver died in hospital Sunday after ending up in a ditch on Route 343 in Joliette, 50 kilometres north of Montreal.

A passerby alerted 911 at about 10:20 a.m. to the presence of a vehicle in a ditch between Albert-Geoffroy St. and Rang de la Petite Noraie; it had been there for some time, said Sûreté du Québec spokesperson Beatrice Dorsainville. The driver was brought to a hospital in critical condition but later died of his injuries.

The driver, who was alone in his vehicle, appeared to have missed a curve and left the road before ending up in the ditch, Dorsainville said.

Collision investigators were dispatched to the scene to try to determine the circumstances of the event.
