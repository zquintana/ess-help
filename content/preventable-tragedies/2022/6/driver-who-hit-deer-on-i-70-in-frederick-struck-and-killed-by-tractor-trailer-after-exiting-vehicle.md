A man is dead Friday after he was struck by a tractor-trailer on Interstate 70 in Frederick, Maryland, after he got out of his vehicle because he hit a deer on the highway.

Maryland State Police said Jordan Scott Maddocks, 33, of Canal Fulton, Ohio, was struck by a tractor-trailer on westbound I-70 around 3 a.m.

He apparently got out of his vehicle after striking a deer before the MD Route 17 exit for Myersville. Maddocks was declared dead around 3:30 a.m.

The WTOP Traffic Center reported that westbound I-70, which was closed following the incident, was reopened to all lanes of traffic by 6:40 a.m.

Three others in Maddocksâ€™ vehicle were all uninjured.
