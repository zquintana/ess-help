AIKEN, S.C. (WRDW/WAGT) - Three people are dead after a series of fatal crashes.

The latest crash happened around 2:51 a.m. Monday in Orangeburg County.

The South Carolina Highway Patrol says a 2016 Jeep Patriot stopped on the westbound side of Interstate 26, near mile marker 147. The car stopped in the right lane with the car lights off, and a tractor-trailer came traveling down the interstate and struck the rear of the Jeep.

The driver of the Jeep was pronounced dead on the scene. The driver of the tractor-trailer didnâ€™t suffer injuries.
