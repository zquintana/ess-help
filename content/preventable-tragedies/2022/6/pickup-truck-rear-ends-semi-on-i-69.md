DEKALB COUNTY, Ind. (WANE) — A crash snarled traffic on southbound Interstate 69 in southern DeKalb County for more than an hour Friday afternoon.

The crash happened around 3:20 p.m. in the southbound lanes of the interstate, in the area of C.R. 68, about five miles north of the Union Chapel Road interchange.

The DeKalb County Sheriff’s Department said John Poss, 58, of Paducah, Texas, was driving a semi in the right lane and started to slow down for a traffic backup, turning on his hazard lights. Austin Treesh, 29, of Wolcottville, was driving a Dodge Dakota pickup truck behind the semi. He told officers he was looking at the east side of the road and when he looked forward again, he saw the semi slowing down.

The pickup rear-ended the semi and then continued to the left of the semi and hit the passenger side of a Jeep Grand Cherokee driven by Jason Hanna, 49, of Fort Wayne. The Jeep, which was in the left lane, ended up in the median.

The pickup truck had a lot of front end damage. No one was hurt.

Traffic was diverted to the shoulder between the 323 and 324 mile markers on southbound I-69 for about 72 minutes.
