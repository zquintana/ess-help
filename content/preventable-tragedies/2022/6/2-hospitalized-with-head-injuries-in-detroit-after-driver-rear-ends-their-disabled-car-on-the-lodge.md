DETROIT (WWJ) -- Two people are hospitalized with severe head injuries after a driver rear-ended their stalled car on the Lodge Freeway in Detroit.

Michigan State Police say they received a call around 1:25 a.m. Wednesday about a Honda Odyssey blocking the right lane of the Lodge northbound at Hamilton.

On their way to the scene, troopers were notified that a crash occurred. The Honda, which was disabled, ended up getting rear-ended by a Jeep Wrangler.

The Jeep stopped in the right lane while the Honda came to rest in the left lane, further north from the location of the crash.

Both occupants in the Honda sustained critical head injuries and are currently hospitalized.

The freeway was closed at Hamilton for the investigation but opened just before 5 a.m.
