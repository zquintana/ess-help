A male driver of a disabled vehicle was struck and killed in a hit-and-run vehicular incident on Parkway East early Sunday morning, state police said.

Troopers responded to the scene around 2:19 a.m. near Exit-73 Oakland/Glenwood.

The vehicle owned by Zaonte Davis, 24, of Clairton, became disabled in the eastbound lanes, according to police. Mr. Davis had called an acquaintance for help. That person pulled onto the shoulder of the westbound lanes of the parkway.

When Mr. Davis attempted to cross all lanes of traffic on foot to reach the other side, he was struck by a vehicle.

Police said he was in the center lane of the westbound side when he was hit. It is believed that he was hit by a second vehicle while lying in the road.

Mr. Davis was pronounced dead at the scene by ambulance medical staff.

The vehicles involved in the crash did not stop to give aid or information, state police said in a statement Sunday evening.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with relevant information is encouraged to call Pennsylvania State Policeâ€™s Pittsburgh Station at 412-299-1607.
