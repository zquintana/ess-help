A three-vehicle crash on northbound I-25 in northern Douglas County on Saturday afternoon injured three people and shut down the highway for about an hour.

The crash happened at about 1:25 p.m. near the Ridgegate Parkway exchange, said Sgt. Troy Kessler of the Colorado State Patrol.

A motorcyclist, a 33-year-old Texas man, had pulled over on the shoulder of the highway and parked the motorcycle, Kessler said. The driver of a 2022 Hyundai utility vehicle also pulled over to help the motorcyclist.

The driver of the Hyundai, a 57-year-old man from California, and the motorcyclist were both in the utility vehicle when the driver of a 2005 Ford F-150 pickup truck hit the motorcycle and the Hyundai. The driver of the truck, a 37-year-old woman, was described as the “at-fault driver.”

All three people were taken to local hospitals with injuries. Details on their injuries were not released. The highway was shut down in the area for about one hour. An investigation is ongoing.
