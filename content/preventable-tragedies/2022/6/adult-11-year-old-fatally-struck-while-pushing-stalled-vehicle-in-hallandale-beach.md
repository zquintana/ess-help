An 11-year-old and an adult were struck and killed while trying to push a stalled Jeep out of the road in Hallandale Beach on Saturday night.

According to the incident report, the Jeep had become disabled in the roadway and a Good Samaritan parked his vehicle to help push the Jeep out of the road with his 11-year-old son.

As they were assisting the driver of the Jeep, police said a gray Ford struck the Jeep, the driver, the good Samaritan and his son from behind.

They transported the three injured individuals to a local hospital for treatment, where the driver of the Jeep and the 11-year-old boy were pronounced dead.

The good Samaritan was still hospitalized and being treated for his injuries.

The driver of the gray Ford stayed on the scene and was treated at a hospital before being released. Police said the driver is cooperating with the investigation.
