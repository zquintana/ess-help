KINGS COUNTY, CA (June 16, 2022) – On Tuesday, three people sustained injuries following a multi-vehicle crash at Interstate 5.

The collision happened 11:10 p.m., June 14th, along the I-5 just north of Highway 41, south of Kettleman City.

Officials said the first crash occurred when an Audi traveling southbound on the I-5 made an unsafe turn and collided with the side of a big rig trailer driving in the same direction.

The Audi driver lost control and the car overturned, landing on its roof, while the big rig went down an embankment and into a ravine.

A witness said the Audi driver got out of his car to look down into the ravine at the big rig when he was hit by a box truck.

The box truck driver failed to stop, and authorities are now searching for the driver.

Responding medics then airlifted both the big rig driver and the car’s driver to a hospital with serious injuries.

In addition, other medics rushed a passenger in the big rig to the hospital with minor injuries.

At this time, CHP officials have not released the names of the injured parties or their current conditions. However, an active investigation is currently underway.

One small driving mistake can lead to multi-vehicle accidents. That is why it is important to always keep your attention on the road when behind the wheel. Also, do not put yourself and your passengers in danger by speeding and taking shortcuts. By driving defensively and always abiding by all driving laws, you can help avoid accidents on the road.
