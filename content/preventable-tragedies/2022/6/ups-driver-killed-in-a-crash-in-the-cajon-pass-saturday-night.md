CAJON PASS, CA. (Pain In The Pass) >> Male UPS semi driver was killed and one person was injured in a crash Saturday night on Interstate 15, authorities said.

California Highway Patrol and firefighters from San Bernardino County Fire Department responded to the traffic accident. The accident was reported at about 8:17pm, Saturday June 11, 2022. Located on northbound Interstate 15 just after Cleghorn Road.

From what the CHP traffic log stated for unknown reasons the UPS semi driver lost control or veered then made contact to the right shoulder embankment. This may have caused the driver to be ejected onto the traffic lanes. Then the UPS driver may have hit by a passing semi tractor trailer. The semi driver did stay near the scene and was cooperating with the investigation. Remember this is a preliminary report from the CHP traffic log.

Despite life-saving rescue measures, firefighters and CHP officials said the UPS driver was pronounced deceased at the scene in the center divider. CHP temporarily shutdown all the lanes for the investigation. Three lanes were reopened at 9pm, the fast lane was open by 10:45pm. One person was reported to be transported to a local hospital in unknown condition.

We will update this story with more information when the CHPâ€™s preliminary accident report is available. Additional details were limited at this time. This incident will be under investigation by the California Highway Patrol San Bernardino Inland Office. CHP says additional information will be updated as it becomes available.
