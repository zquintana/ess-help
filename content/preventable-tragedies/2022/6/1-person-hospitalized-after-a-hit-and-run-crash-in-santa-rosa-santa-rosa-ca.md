On Thursday night, one person suffered injuries following a multi-vehicle wreck in Santa Rosa.

As per the initial information, the hit-and-run crash took place at approximately 11 p.m. on the westbound Highway 12 near the Stony Point Road exit. The preliminary investigation indicated that the Maxima driver sideswiped a Toyota Prius, which traveled off the roadway and rolled onto its roof.

After that, the Maxima hit the center guardrail and ended up in the middle of the right lane.  A Toyota Camry then crashed into the Maxima and stopped. The Camry was hit by another Camry and a GMC Acadia drove into some debris.

According to the officials, the male driver of the Nissan Maxima ran from the scene on foot, leaving his car behind. On arrival, emergency crews transported one person to a hospital with minor injuries. No other details are made available.

An investigation into the crash is ongoing.
