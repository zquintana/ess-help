title: "Woman dead, 2 others injured after a five-vehicle pile-up in Long Beach (Long Beach, CA)"
---
A woman lost her life while two others received injuries following a multi-vehicle wreck overnight in Long Beach.

As per the initial information, the fatal five-vehicle pile-up took place on the 710 Freeway. The preliminary investigation showed that the womanâ€™s car apparently broke down on the freeway when it was rear-ended by four other vehicles. On arrival, emergency responders found the woman dead outside her car. A second woman suffered injuries and was transported to the hospital. She was conscious and breathing at that time.

According to the authorities, a man was found further down the road approximately a quarter-mile down in a heavily destroyed SUV. He was also rushed to a local hospital with unspecified injuries. All lanes on the northbound 710 Freeway were closed as crews worked at the scene but have since reopened. No other details are made available.

The incident remains under active review.
