HOLMDEL – Seven people were injured in a multi-vehicle crash on the Garden State Parkway early Monday morning, New Jersey State Police spokeswoman Brandi Slota said.

Troopers responded to a report of a collision near milepost 116.8 in Holmdel about 3:15 a.m., Slota said.

An on-scene investigation revealed that a GMC Sierra pickup collided with a Hyundai Elantra from the rear, according to police.

The Hyundai subsequently hit  an Acura MDX that was disabled because it was  involved in an earlier crash, police said.

At the time of the accident, the driver and five passengers were standing outside of the Acura SUV, authorities said.

The driver of the Hyundai as well as four of the people standing outside the Acura were seriously injured, State Police said. Another two people standing near the Acura suffered minor injuries, according to police.

Officials have not released the identities of anyone involved in the collision.

The investigation into the crash is ongoing, Slota said. 

Allstate insurance company's most recent guide for what to do after a collision says to get to the side of the road or to a sidewalk, if there is one. It also recommends moving the vehicle to the side of the road if it is drivable. 

Allstate also suggests turning on the vehicle's hazard lights while waiting for first responders to arrive. 

Police did not say whether the Acura and its occupants were in a lane of the Parkway or on the shoulder.
