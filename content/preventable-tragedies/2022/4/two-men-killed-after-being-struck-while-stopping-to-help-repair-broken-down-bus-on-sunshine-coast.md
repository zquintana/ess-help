Two men have died after being hit by a car while they were repairing a broken down bus on a Sunshine Coast road.

The men, aged 22 and 25, were struck on Nambour Connection Road in Woombye about 3.30pm on Thursday.

They were both taken to Sunshine Coast University Hospital with “life-threatening injuries”, Queensland Ambulance Service’s Shane Kropp said.

“The patients’ condition was they had what we call multisystem trauma,” Kropp said, “they’ve got life-threatening injuries. Advanced care and critical care paramedics were on board and treated them accordingly.”

He described the scene as “chaotic”.

Both men died from their injuries in hospital.

Two lanes of the road were closed northwest bound towards Maroochydore Road, with motorists urged to avoid the area.

The lanes were reopened about 6.30pm.

A 43-year-old woman, who was behind the wheel of the car, is assisting police with their inquiries.

She was not injured in the crash.

“The Forensic Crash Unit and Workplace Health and Safety are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident,” Queensland Police said in a statement.

Anyone with information or dashcam vision is urged to contact police.
