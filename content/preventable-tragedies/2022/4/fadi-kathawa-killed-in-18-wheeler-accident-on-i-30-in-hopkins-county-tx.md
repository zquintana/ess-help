Hopkins County, TX -- March 9, 2022, 29-year-old Fadi Kathawa was killed in a collision between two 18-wheelers on Interstate 30 in Hopkins County.

Authorities say the incident happened around 11:00 p.m. on I-30 roughly 7 miles east of Sulphur Springs. Preliminary investigation suggests Kathawa was driving a Freightliner big rig east on the highway when he lost control for unknown reasons. The truck veered out of the travel lane and hit a guardrail, then rolled over across the eastbound lanes. Shortly afterward it was hit by an International tractor-trailer driven by 33-year-old Lester Brown.

Kathawa was ejected from his truck during the crash and suffered fatal injuries. Brown was treated and released at the scene.

No further information is available at this time.
