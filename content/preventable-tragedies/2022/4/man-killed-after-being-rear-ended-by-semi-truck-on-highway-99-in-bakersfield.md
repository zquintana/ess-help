title: "Man Killed After Being Rear-Ended by Semi Truck on Highway 99 in Bakersfield"
---
Seluster Lane, 77, of Redwood City, was killed in a truck accident in Bakersfield early on the morning of March 29.

According to a KGET news report, the fatal truck crash occurred on Highway 99 just north of Merced Avenue.

California Highway Patrol officers who responded to the scene saw that Lane had been ejected from his vehicle. He died at the scene as a result of injuries he suffered in the collision.

Ongoing Investigation

Officers later determined that Lane’s minivan was stopped in the slow lane for unknown reasons. The minivan was hit from behind by the semi-truck causing Lane to get ejected. The driver of the semi-truck was not injured and remained at the scene. CHP officials say they don’t believe at this time that alcohol or drugs were factors in this fatal crash. The investigation is still ongoing.

We offer our deepest condolences to the family members of Seluster Lane for their tragic loss. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.
