SELMA, N.C. â€” A man was struck and killed on U.S. Highway 70 overnight after he exited his car and tried to wave down a truck for help.

Authorities told WRAL News the man stepped into the path of an eastbound pickup truck on U.S. 70 near Buffalo Road late Wednesday evening. He was killed instantly.

The North Carolina State Highway said the man got out of his disabled vehicle to flag down help. A gas can was located inside his small SUV and the door to his gas cap was open.

The pickup truck driver was shaken but uninjured. He reported to authorities that the pedestrian stepped into his path waving his arms on the dark stretch of road between Wilson's Mills and Selma.

U.S. 70 was closed for nearly two hours during the investigation.

The name of the victim is being withheld until family can be notified.
