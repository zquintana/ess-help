JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – A 9-year-old boy was among two killed after an early morning crash on Interstate 95, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

FHP said that just before 5 a.m. a truck was stopped in the emergency lane of I-95 just south of the Pecan Park Road exit. Two passengers of the stopped truck were standing beside the vehicle on the shoulder, FHP said.

While they were standing there, an SUV traveling on I-95 northbound veered into the emergency shoulder where it struck the stopped truck and two passengers.

The child and the 35-year-old male driver were transported to a local hospital where they were pronounced dead. Another 36-year-old female passenger inside the stopped truck was not hurt.

The driver of the SUV, a 24-year-old female from Yulee, was not hurt in the crash. FHP said it is investigating the cause of the crash.

Lanes were blocked on I-95 at Pecan Park Rd. around 9:30 a.m. and it’s unclear how long they will be closed.

Traffic is being diverted to Airport Road.
