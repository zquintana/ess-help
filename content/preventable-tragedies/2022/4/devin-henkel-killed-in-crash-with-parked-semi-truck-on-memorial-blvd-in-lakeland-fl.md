title: "Devin Henkel Killed in Crash with Parked Semi-Truck on Memorial Blvd in Lakeland, FL"
---
Lakeland, FL -- April 10, 2022, 28-year-old Devin Henkel was killed in a collision with a semi-truck on West Memorial Boulevard in Lakeland.

Authorities say the incident happened shortly before 7:45 a.m. on the 2900 block of West Memorial Blvd. Preliminary investigation suggests a commercial tractor-trailer was stopped on the eastbound shoulder with its hazard lights activated. Henkel, eastbound in a Nissan Frontier on the roadway, reportedly veered onto the shoulder for unknown reasons and collided with the stopped truck's trailer. The Nissan struck with enough force to become wedged underneath the trailer.

Henkel was pronounced dead at the scene. The truck driver, 60-year-old Allen Greene, was unhurt.

No further information is available at this time.
