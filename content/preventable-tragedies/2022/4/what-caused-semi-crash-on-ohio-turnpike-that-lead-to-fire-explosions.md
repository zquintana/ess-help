title: "What caused semi crash on Ohio Turnpike that lead to fire, explosions"
---
LORAIN COUNTY, Ohio (WJW) – The Ohio State Highway Patrol is investigating a massive fire that followed a crash involving two semi-trucks Wednesday night on the Ohio Turnpike.

It happened in the eastbound lanes of I-80 near Murray Ridge Road.

Just after 8:15 p.m., OSHP says a semi-truck became stuck in the right lane due to an issue with the vehicle.

Another semi-driver hit that truck, ran off the road and hit the concrete median.

Both semi trucks caught fire.

One of the semis was transporting hazardous material that continued to explode for an hour after the crash.

Incredibly, neither driver was hurt in the crash.

No charges have been issued.

Both drivers were wearing their seatbelts. Alcohol does not appear to be a factor, OSHP reports.

Both east and westbound lanes of the Ohio Turnpike were shut down until early Thursday morning.

A statement from the Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission says:

“We are still determining the extent of damage to the Ohio Turnpike. Our initial review indicates that some pavement, the concrete median wall and guardrail will need repair.  

The left lanes in both directions between milepost 141.4 – 143.4 in Amherst remain closed overnight for vehicle removal and cleanup. Once this cleanup is completed, the westbound left lane will be reopened.

The eastbound left lane will remain closed as the pavement is damaged beyond use and will be repaired as soon as possible.”
