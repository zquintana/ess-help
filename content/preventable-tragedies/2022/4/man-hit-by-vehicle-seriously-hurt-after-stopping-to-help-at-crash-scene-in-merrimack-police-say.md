title: "Man hit by vehicle, seriously hurt after stopping to help at crash scene in Merrimack, police say"

MERRIMACK, N.H. â€”

A man who stopped to help at a crash scene on the Everett Turnpike in Merrimack early Friday morning was struck by a vehicle and seriously hurt.

The 59-year-old man from Manchester had pulled over to the right side of the turnpike near mile marker 13 and was walking toward the crash scene when he was struck, police said. The victim was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Police said the vehicle entered the grass shoulder off the right side of the highway and hit the man. The vehicle left without stopping, and police are asking for the public's help in tracking it down.

"The crash scene was ongoing for a while, so we're really looking for any witnesses that could come forward if they saw the accident," said Trooper Tim Repucci. "Maybe people have dashcam footage that's usually rolling on their car or witnessed a vehicle driving away."

The victim's name was not released.

There were several crashes reported across New Hampshire as heavy rain fell Friday morning.

Anyone who witnessed the hit-and-run, passed by the area with a dashboard camera installed or has seen a vehicle with front-end damage or a broken passenger headlight is asked to contact Trooper Luan Sanches at Luan.G.Sanches@dos.nh.gov or 1-603-227-0114.
