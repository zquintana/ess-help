One person received injuries after a truck crashed into a disabled vehicle Tuesday night in Connell.

As per the initial information, the traffic collision took place on U.S. 395 in Franklin County. Authorities actively responded to the scene on U.S. 395 at milepost 56 in Connell at about 5:33 p.m. on April 5 on reports of a crash. The preliminary reports showed that a 50-year-old truck driver from Kennewick was traveling northbound on S.R. 395 at the same time as another vehicle.

The reports also revealed that the second vehicle got disabled and was blocking the right lane of the roadway. According to the authorities, the vehicle had its hazard placards out to let the oncoming drivers know that something was wrong with their car. The Kennewick man got reportedly distracted and slammed his truck into the disabled vehicle on the roadway adjacent to the City of Connell.

On arrival, first responders rushed the truck driver to Lourdes Medical Center for emergency evaluation and treatment. His current condition remains unknown at this time, but WSP Troopers state he faces a second-degree Negligent Driving charge for his inattention. The condition of the person whose vehicle got hit also remains unclear.

Authorities also confirmed that both the vehicles involved were totaled as a result of the wreck. The incident did not cause any other injuries. Intoxication from drugs and/or alcohol was not involved in the crash. No other details are available.

An investigation is ongoing.
