Two men are dead after stepping onto Interstate 95 in Dania Beach on Sunday to pull an object from the highway, said the Florida Highway Patrol.

According to the highway patrol, the men were travelling south in a white Chevy pickup near the State Road 84 exit when the driver pulled to the shoulder of the interstate so he and his passenger could get the object.

The two men were struck by an unknown vehicle, and the driver did not stop after striking the men. A second motorist also struck the two men, though that driver did stop.

The Florida Highway Patrol has not released the names of the victims. The patrol is encouraging anyone who may have witnessed the incident to dial *347.
