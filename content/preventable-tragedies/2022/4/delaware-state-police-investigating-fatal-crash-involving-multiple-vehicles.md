Delaware State Police are investigating a fatal crash involving multiple vehicles that occurred Monday morning on Interstate 95.

On Monday, April 11, 2022, at approximately 4:38 a.m., a 2014 Chevrolet Sonic was traveling southbound on I-95 south of Route 141. At this time, a 2011 Dodge Ram was also traveling southbound on I-95 in the area of the Sonic. For reasons unknown, the Sonic struck the right rear corner of the Ram, which caused the operator of the Sonic to lose control and then strike the guardrail along the left edge of the roadway. As a result of the second impact, the Sonic traveled back into the southbound lanes of I-95 and became disabled in the roadway, without any lights activated. The Ram came to a controlled stop on the right shoulder.

A 2007 Kenworth tractor trailer that was traveling southbound on I-95 and whoâ€™s operator was unable to see Sonic disabled in the roadway, struck the Sonic with its front. After impact, the tractor trailer continued south and struck the center median prior to coming to a stop. Subsequently, a 2020 GMC Sierra that was traveling southbound also attempted to avoid the Sonic disabled in the roadway, but struck the vehicle with its right side. A 2022 Western Star tractor trailer traveling southbound on I-95 also struck the Sonic.

After the collisions, the front of the Sonic caught fire and the 62-year-old male operator from Bear, DE was removed from the vehicle by responding troopers. The operator was was transported to Christiana Hospital where he was later pronounced deceased. The identification of the victim is pending notification to the next of kin.

All other remaining operators involved refused medical attention.
