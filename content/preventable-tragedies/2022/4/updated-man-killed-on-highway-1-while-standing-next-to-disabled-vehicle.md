A man was killed on Highway 1 on the Oxnard Plain Friday morning while standing next to a disabled vehicle on the shoulder, according to the California Highway Patrol.

The accident north of Wood Road was reported around 7 a.m. The site is in an unincorporated agricultural area south of Hueneme Road, near Naval Base Ventura County, Point Mugu.

Marcelo Santos, 34, a Gardena resident, was standing next to a disabled 2000 Ford Explorer SUV parked on the right northbound shoulder, according to Officer Vince Rangel of the CHP's Ventura office. An Inglewood man, 51, was a passenger in the Ford.

A 33-year-old Port Hueneme man was driving northbound on the highway in a 2018 Volkswagen Atlas SUV. For reasons still under investigation, he veered toward the shoulder, hitting Santos and the Explorer, according to the CHP account.

Santos was pronounced dead at the scene by Oxnard Fire Department personnel.

The passenger in the Ford and the driver of the Volkswagen were not injured, officials said.

The incident closed the left southbound lane for a time and fully closed northbound lanes from Las Posas Road. The southbound lane was open by 8:30 a.m. and northbound lanes reopened by 12:30 p.m.

As of Friday afternoon, officials said it wasn't clear whether drugs or alcohol played a role in the crash. No arrests were reported. The incident remains under investigation.
