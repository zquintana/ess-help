FRESNO, Calif. (FOX26) â€” Northbound Hwy. 99 was shut down early Tuesday morning following a crash involving several vehicles.

The California Highway Patrol (CHP) said officers were called to Hwy. 99 north of North Ave. around 3:15 a.m. Tuesday, where three or four cars crashed.

CHP says 66-year-old Aloma Waith of Stockton was driving a Dodge Stratus when she veered off the highway, overcorrected, and hit a concrete wall causing her vehicle to become disabled in the fast lane.

Waith then got out of her car and was trying to remove the damaged rear bumper of the vehicle that was still in the lane of traffic.

A Fresno man driving a Nissan Murano stopped at the scene of the crash directly behind the disabled Dodge.

A Fresno woman driving a Jeep Cherokee did not see the Nissan stopped on the highway in time and crashed into it, pushing it forward into the woman in the roadway.

CHP says two other vehicles, a Hyundai Sonata and Chevrolet Silverado, also crashed into the Nissan.

The Stockton woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

All four of the other drivers received minor injuries.

It's unknown at this time if alcohol and/or drugs are a factor in this crash.
