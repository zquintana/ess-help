CABAZON (CNS) â€“ One person was killed and another was critically injured today in a fiery crash involving a big rig and a pickup truck on eastbound Interstate 10 in Cabazon.

According to the California Highway Patrol, shortly before 2 a.m., the driver of a Toyota Tundra pickup heading east drifted off the roadway for unknown reasons and struck a series of sand-filled barricades along the right shoulder just west of the Main Street off-ramp.

The pickup eventually rolled over, coming to a stop on the freeway, with no lights on, according to the CHP. Moments later, the pickup was struck by an eastbound Kenworth big rig hauling a shipping container.

CHP officials said the big rig driver attempted to swerve to avoid the overturned pickup, but struck the vehicle at about 55 to 60 mph.
