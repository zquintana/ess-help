Irondale, AL -- April 5, 2022, 33-year-old Edy Osorio and 52-year-old Victor Ventura died when an SUV collided with a tractor-trailer on Interstate 20 near Irondale.

Authorities say the incident happened around 6:20 a.m. on eastbound I-20 near mile marker 136. Preliminary investigation suggests Osorio was driving a Toyota RAV4 on the highway when they collided with the rear of a tractor-trailer that had stopped due to a previous crash up the road. The impact caused the Toyota to become wedged underneath the truck's trailer.

Osorio and Ventura were both pronounced dead at the scene.

The investigation continues. No further information is currently available.
