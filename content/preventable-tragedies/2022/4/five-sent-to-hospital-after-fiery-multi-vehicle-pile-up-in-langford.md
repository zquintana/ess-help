title: "Five sent to hospital after fiery multi-vehicle pile-up in Langford"
---
Northbound lanes on the Trans-Canada Highway have partially re-opened following a multi-vehicle crash and vehicle fire near the start of the Malahat at West Shore Parkway.

It was just one of several crashes Friday morning, and motorists are being advised to expect delays and to avoid the area if possible.

Langford Fire Rescue acting Assistant Chief Simon Chadwick said the call came in just after 10 a.m. for a report of a multi-vehicle crash and fire.

The initial crash involved a collision between a semi-truck and a car, resulting in the car catching fire. A five-vehicle pile-up ensued after the initial crash.

All occupants were out of their vehicles when emergency crews arrived.

B.C. Emergency Health Services was called to the scene with an initial report of up to 10 vehicles being involved in the incident.

Five patients were transported to hospital in stable condition.

Northbound lanes on the Trans-Canada Highway and West Shore Parkway were closed for more than an hour before partially reopening at around 11 a.m.

An update from DriveBC is expected at 2:30 p.m. with northbound traffic on the Trans-Canada Highway still down to one lane at West Shore Parkway.
