title: "Two killed in rear-end collision on North Kihei Road"

Two people who were asleep in a parked car were killed when a pickup truck drifted onto the shoulder of North Kihei Road and rear-ended the vehicle early Sunday morning, according to the Maui Police Department.

Preliminary investigation reveals a 2020 Toyota Tacoma pickup truck was traveling southeast on North Kihei Road, drifted onto the shoulder of the roadway and collided into the rear of a white 2003 Nissan Sentra four-door sedan that was parked on the shoulder about 2.2 miles southeast of Honoapiilani Highway around 4:05 a.m.

Police said that the driver of the Toyota pickup truck, a 21-year-old male from Kihei, sustained minor injuries and was transported to the Maui Memorial Medical Center Emergency Room for treatment.

The driver was wearing his seat belt at the time of the collision. The airbags did deploy.

The occupants of the Nissan sedan, a 47-year- old female and a 52-year-old male, were asleep within the vehicle when the collision occurred and were pronounced dead at the scene.

Police said that the victims’ identities are currently being withheld for 24 hours to allow their families an opportunity to notify their extended family and friends.

The involvement of speed, drugs and alcohol has not been determined yet as the investigation is still ongoing, police said.

These are Maui County’s seventh and eighth traffic fatalities of 2022, compared to one at the same time last year.
