Crosby County, TX -- April 1, 2022, Austin Redder was killed due to an accident where a vehicle hit Redder following a previous accident.

Investigators reported that the crash took place at around 4:00 a.m. along US 82 a few miles east of Crosbyton.

Authorities said that 26-year-old Austin Redder was in a vehicle traveling along the highway when the vehicle somehow went off-road, lost control, and crashed into a guardrail. While in the roadway, police say Redder got out of the vehicle. Some time later, a Dodge Journey hit Redder.

Redder ultimately succumbed to fatal injuries. The other driver involved reportedly was uninjured, and reports made no mention of potential charges. Right now, additional details surrounding the accident are unclear.
