Lupton, AZ -- April 9, 2022, 21-year-old Chelsea Valladares and 22-year-old Kelli Ingle were killed in a crash with a tractor-trailer on Interstate 40 near Lupton.

Reports say the incident happened shortly after 11:00 p.m. on eastbound I-40 near the Arizona/New Mexico border. Preliminary investigation suggests the victims were in a passenger vehicle on the interstate when the driver drifted left for unknown reasons and the car hit a guardrail. It came to a stop at least partially blocking one travel lane and not long after it was hit by a commercial 18-wheeler.

The car's passenger was pronounced dead at the scene; the driver was transported to a Gallup, NM hospital where she later died. No other injuries were reported. 

No further information is available at this time.
