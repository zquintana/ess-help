title: "Local woman killed in multi-vehicle crash on Spaulding Turnpike in Dover"

DOVER - A multi-vehicle fatal crash on the Spaulding Turnpike Tuesday at around 5:30 a.m, shut down two southbound lanes of traffic after the Dover toll booth and before the Little Bay Bridge, near mile marker 4.8.

According to New Hampshire State Police, the crash has resulted in a single fatality. Kyla Morgan, a 38-year-old woman from Barrington, was pronounced dead on the scene.

Three vehicles were involved in the crash, each with only one occupant. Besides the fatality, no other injuries were reported, State Police said. 

Troopers from the New Hampshire State Police Troop A Barracks received a report of a two-vehicle collision around 5:30 a.m. Tuesday morning. Moments later, additional reports were made that a third vehicle was involved.

The investigation found that a 2000 Volvo sedan operated by a 26-year-old man from Kittery, Maine, and a 2013 Nissan Sentra operated by Morgan were traveling southbound from the Dover Toll Plaza. 

State Police said the drivers were parallel to one another in two different travel lanes. After passing the Route 4 overpass, Morgan’s vehicle encroached into the travel lane of the Kittery man, which caused both operators to take evasive steering actions that led to both drivers losing control of their vehicles.

The Kittery man deviated from the right side of the roadway and came to a stop on the Exit 6 Southbound on-ramp, while Morgan’s vehicle continued in the opposing direction and collided with a concrete barrier along the median-side of the roadway. After striking the barrier, Morgan’s vehicle was left stalled in a perpendicular angle in the roadway, according to State Police. 

Moments later, a 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 operated by a 48-year-old man from Farmington, was traveling southbound in the left lane and struck the rear end of Morgan’s vehicle. This second impact dislodged Morgan from the vehicle. State Police said that despite lifesaving efforts, Morgan was pronounced deceased on scene.

Preliminary investigation indicates that distraction by an electronic device may have contributed to the start of this incident, however the investigation is active and ongoing, according to State Police.

The southbound lanes reopened by 10 a.m. The Dover Fire Department and New Hampshire Department of Transportation were also dispatched to the call.

State Police are requesting that anyone who may have witnessed the incident contact Trooper Gary Wood at Gary.J.Woodjr@dos.nh.gov or by voicemail at (603) 223-4381.
