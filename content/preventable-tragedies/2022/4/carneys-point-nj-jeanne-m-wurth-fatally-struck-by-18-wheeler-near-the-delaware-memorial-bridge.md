Carneys Point, NJ (April 19, 2022) – A pedestrian was fatally struck by an 18-wheeler on the New Jersey Turnpike on Monday, April 18th at about 11:00 p.m.

53-year-old Jeanne M. Wurth, a resident of Pittsgrove, was standing on the lefthand shoulder of the northbound lanes of the turnpike just before the Delaware Memorial Bride next to her disabled vehicle when she was hit by a passing 18-wheeler.

The truck operator had swerved to the left in an attempt to avoid striking Wurth’s vehicle and struck Wurth instead. 

She died at the scene. 

We would like to offer our deepest condolences to the family of the deceased victim, Mrs. Jeanne M. Wurth, at this time.
