A driver suffered injuries after his truck crashed into a disabled vehicle on Interstate 90 in Erie County on Thursday, according to Pennsylvania State Police.

It was reported in the eastbound lanes near the 19.8 mile marker in McKean Township around 9:42 p.m.

A Chevrolet Silverado truck was disabled in the right travel lane with its hazard lights on when another Chevrolet truck hit the rear-end of the disabled vehicle, State Police said.

Both vehicles suffered heavy damage and had to be towed from the scene, troopers said.

The 31-year-old Union City man who was behind the wheel of the truck that crashed into the disabled vehicle was taken to UPMC Hamot for treatment of a severe leg injury.

The 53-year-old Foley, Alabama, man who was in the disabled vehicle went to the same hospital with minor injuries.
