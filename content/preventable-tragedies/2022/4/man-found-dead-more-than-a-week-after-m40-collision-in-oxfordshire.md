A man has been found dead eight days after a collision on a motorway in Oxfordshire, police have said.

Officers were called to reports of a black Vauxhall Astra car in the wooded central reservation between junctions 11 and 12 of the M40 on Tuesday.

Thames Valley police said it believes the crash happened more than a week earlier, at around 04:20 BST on 5 April.

"Sadly a man in his 40s was found to have died," the force said.

His next of kin have been informed.
