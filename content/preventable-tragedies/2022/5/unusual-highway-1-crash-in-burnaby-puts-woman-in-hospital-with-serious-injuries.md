title: "Unusual Highway 1 crash in Burnaby puts woman in hospital with serious injuries"
---
A woman was taken to hospital early Saturday with serious injuries after being struck while on the roadway of Highway 1 eastbound at the Kensington on-ramp.

Burnaby RCMP said it happened at about 4 a.m. Saturday. A blue 2010 Audi A5 with a driver and female passenger had temporarily pulled over to the shoulder of the road and the woman got out of the car.

Then the vehicle was struck by a driver in a black 2009 Acura CSX. It then struck the woman as she was standing on the roadway.

The 26-year-old woman was taken to hospital with what police said may be “life-altering injuries.”

“Our investigators have spoken to the parties involved, but are seeking any witnesses who may have observed the events leading up to the collision,” said Cpl. Alexa Hodgins of Burnaby RCMP.

The driver of the Acura remained at the scene. Investigators are trying to determine if speed, driver impairment and road conditions are factors in the collision.

Police urge any witnesses with dashcam footage to contact Burnaby RCMP at 604-646-9999.
