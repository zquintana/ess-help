UPDATE: A 1-year-old girl has died after she and her mother were hit by cars as they tried crossing the street following a crash on May 1, Cobb County police confirmed to McClatchy News in a statement. The original story continues below. A woman was killed and her young daughter was critically hurt after they were hit by two cars while trying to cross the road after a car crash, according to Georgia authorities. The accident occurred Sunday, May 1 just before 9:30 p.m., Cobb County police said in a news release.

Kayanne K.L. Dunn, 37, of Hiram was headed eastbound on C.H. James Parkway, just west of the Oglesby Road intersection, when her 2017 Nissan Sentra collided with the rear of another car in the left lane, police said. She got out of her car after it came to a stop. With her 1-year-old in her arms, police said Dunn started walking toward Oglesby Road when she was struck by a 2021 Chevrolet Blazer going westbound on C.H. James Parkway. A 2016 Ford Taurus that was traveling behind the Chevy also hit her.

Dunn and her daughter were taken to a hospital, and Dunn died from her injuries, police said. Her baby remains in critical condition as of Tuesday, May 3. Authorities havenâ€™t charged the two drivers and said the crash remains under investigation. Cobb County is about 20 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta.
