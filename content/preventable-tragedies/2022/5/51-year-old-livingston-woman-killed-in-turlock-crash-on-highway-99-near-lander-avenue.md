Turlock, California (May 20, 2022) â€“ Authorities are investigating a Friday afternoon tractor-trailer accident that killed a 51-year-old Livingston woman in Turlock.

The crash occurred at about 1:27 p.m. on southbound Highway 99, south of Lander Avenue.

According to the California Highway Patrol, a 2020 Kenworth tractor-trailer operated by Daljit Singh, 54, of Bakersfield, started experiencing a mechanical issue and Singh pulled onto the west shoulder of the highway.

A southbound 2011 Buick SUV, driven by the Livingston woman, for an unknown reason, drifted onto the westbound shoulder, directly towards the Kenworth. The front of the Buick collided with the rear end of the Kenworth, the officials said.

As a result of the crash impact, the Livingston woman, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was ejected onto the roadway.
