The first in a series of crashes was reported on the northbound I-405 Freeway at Jamboree Road around 1:47 AM.

As authorities arrived on scene they located a crash involving three vehicles, a white Toyota Tacoma, a black Mercedes Benz SUV, and a blue Toyota Mirai that was stopped in lanes.

The 2020 Toyota Mirai was suddenly struck by a grey BMW SUV followed by a white Toyota Corolla hatchback that also collided with debris from the crash.

In total all five vehicles were damaged and at least two people were rushed to area hospitals for treatment.

One person from the crash, believed to be the driver of the Toyota Mirai, was being investigated for possible DUI.
