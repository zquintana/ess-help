A man was killed in Hillsborough Sunday morning while standing outside his car, which had broken down along Interstate-75.

When it stopped functioning in the lanes of Interstate 75 early Sunday morning, a second driver was “unable to stop or avoid a collision” and hit the man, killing him, according to Florida Highway Patrol.

The crash happened at about 2:15 a.m. on I-75 north, around mile marker 263 in Hillsborough.

The 55-year-old man was driving a Dodge Caravan when it “became disabled” and stopped in the lanes, highway patrol said. The man had stepped out to the left his car when a 23-year-old Tampa man headed north hit the left rear side of the Caravan and then the 55-year-old man.

The 55-year-old man died at the scene of the crash, according to highway patrol.

The 23-year-old was traveling with a 24-year-old male passenger, and both sustained minor injuries, according to the report.

No other details, including the names of the people involved, were released.
