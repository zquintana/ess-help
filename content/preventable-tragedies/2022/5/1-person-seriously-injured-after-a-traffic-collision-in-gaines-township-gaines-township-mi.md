On Monday afternoon, one person suffered serious injuries following a motor vehicle accident in Gaines Township.

As per the initial information, the traffic collision took place at about 3:30 p.m. on M-6 near Kalamazoo Avenue. The early reports showed that a vehicle veered out of the way of a vehicle that had broken down on the edge of the freeway.
