LAUDERHILL, Fla. – Lauderhill police are investigating a fatal crash involving a Good Samaritan who had gotten out of his car to help a stranded driver.

The crash occurred just after 11 p.m. Wednesday in the area of State Road 7 and Northwest 26th Street.

According to police, the victim, Erick Veilleux, 42, stopped his black, four-door vehicle in the northbound lanes of State Road 7 to help a driver who had become stranded.

Police said Veilleux tried to cross the roadway from the gas station to bring the other driver fuel, but he was struck by a white Honda that was heading south on State Road 7.

The impact of the crash caused Veilleux to be thrown across the median and onto his own vehicle.

He was transported to Broward Health Medical Center, where he died.

Police said the driver of the Honda remained at the scene and is cooperating with the investigation.

“Early reports suggest that speed may be a factor in this traffic fatality,” police said in a news release.
