title: "MIRACLE ESCAPE Terrifying moment Scots grandad cheats death after leaving broken down taxi seconds before horror crash"
---
THIS is the terrifying moment a Scots grandad had a miracle escape before a horror car crash.

James Mcdowall's taxi broke down on the A71 in Dreghorn, Ayrshire, on Friday and was stranded on the carriageway - with no hard shoulder to pull on to.

He quickly left his vehicle on the busy road to go stand on the side to a safer place.

However, seconds later a van ploughed into the back of the grandad's taxi.

Scary dashcam footage from the inside of the car shows the moment the delivery van smashed into the back of it.

And James had to run for his life and hid behind a tree as the taxi was sent flying towards him at the side of the road after the impact.

James' son Jamie believes that his dad cheated death twice that day after the incident.

He has now sent out a warning to other drivers to leave the car if it's broken down.

A post on Facebook read: "So lucky to still have my dad here today. Somebody was watching out for him.
