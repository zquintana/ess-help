title: "Woman spent days trapped in ravine after crash, Texas cops say. Then she found help"
---
A woman crashed into a Texas ravine, where she became trapped for about two days, according to local reports. She lost consciousness for an undetermined amount of time, authorities said, but after about 40 hours, she managed to climb from the wreckage and out of the ditch, KTBC reported. Upon escaping the crash, “about 16 feet into a creek bed,” she flagged down a driver passing by, KXAN reported. That driver called 911 on Saturday, May 7.

Travis County Emergency Services District #1 responded to the incident in the 18000 block of FM-1431, according to a Facebook post from the department. Photos show the woman’s crushed SUV on its side against a tree.

The woman was taken to a hospital with broken ribs and injuries to her back and skull, KEYE reported. Authorities say she was driving out of Jonestown when her vehicle crossed into an opposite lane and hit a guardrail around 3 a.m. Thursday, May 5, according to KEYE. The SUV was launched into the air before it landed in the ravine, KXAN reported. “What it appears to the investigation was she was traveling at a high rate of speed (and) wasn’t able to navigate the curve,” Jonestown police Officer Joseph Stephens told KTBC. Jonestown is about 35 miles northwest of Austin.
