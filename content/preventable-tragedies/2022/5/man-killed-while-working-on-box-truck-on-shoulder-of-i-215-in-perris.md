title: "Man Killed While Working on Box Truck on Shoulder of I-215 in Perris"
---
A man servicing a box truck on the shoulder of Interstate 215 in Perris was struck and killed Tuesday when a motorist allowed his pickup to drift onto the edge of the freeway and hit him, authorities said.

The fatality occurred at about 10:15 a.m. on northbound I-215, just north of Nuevo Road, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Officer Javier Navarro said the victim, whose identity was not immediately released, stopped the International box truck on the right shoulder to refill the radiator, with the help of a companion riding with him.

Navarro said the victim was attempting to secure the hood latch on the driver’s side after topping off the radiator when the driver of a Toyota Tacoma approached at an undetermined speed in the slow lane.

“For an unknown reason, the Toyota drifted onto the shoulder, colliding into the International and the male pedestrian,” the CHP spokesman said. “The man succumbed to injuries he sustained in the crash.”

Riverside County Fire Department crews reached the location within a few minutes and pronounced the victim dead at the scene.

The other man was not injured, nor was the pickup driver, who immediately stopped, according to Navarro.

“Alcohol is not believed to be a factor in this collision,” he said.

The driver was questioned but not arrested.

The No. 3 lane on northbound I-215 was shut down until about noon while a preliminary investigation was conducted.

The investigation is ongoing, and anyone with information was asked to contact the CHP Riverside office at 951-637-8000.
