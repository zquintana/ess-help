BELTON, Mo. â€” A busy Kansas City-area interstate is back to normal after one lane was closed for hours Wednesday afternoon.

A crash involving six tractor trailers forced emergency crews to close a section of the northbound lanes of Interstate 49 at 163rd Street in Cass County around 1:30 p.m. It reopened shortly before 5 p.m.

Belton police said when they arrived at the scene the crash involved six tractor trailers, an animal transport trailer, a tow truck, and a Ford Explorer. Investigators determined some of the trucks either slid off the highway to avoid a collision, or hit another vehicle in the backup from the original crash.

Several of the trucks are still sitting in the median. They will be towed after rush hour traffic this evening.

There is no word on injuries at this point in the investigation.
