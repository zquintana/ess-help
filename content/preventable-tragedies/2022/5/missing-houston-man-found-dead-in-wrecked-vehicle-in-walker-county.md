HUNTSVILLE, Texas — A Houston man who had been missing a week was found dead Monday in Walker County.

On Monday, Texas DPS confirmed that Henry Schelsteder, 69, was found in a wrecked car along I-45 between mile marker 127 and 128. Officials believe he may have had a medical emergency.

Schelsteder had last been heard from on Monday, May 2, near Madisonville. He had reportedly been on his way to Dallas to make a delivery.

Texas EquuSearch was involved in the search and said there was great concern because Schelsteder is very specific about his stops and takes extra precautions in bad weather.

This is a breaking story. We’ll post any new information as we get it.
