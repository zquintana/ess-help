A 34-year-old man, from Ellensburg, was hurt after his vehicle crashed into a semi-truck in Snoqualmie Pass.

As per the initial information, the two-vehicle crash took place on Interstate 90. The preliminary investigation revealed that 59-year-old Joseph Stygar, from Marysville, was driving a semi-truck west on I-90 when he failed to maintain control on a snowy Interstate 90.

After that, the semi jackknifed and ended up blocking three of the four lanes. The semi was then hit by a 2014 Ford Focus, driven by an Ellensburg man. The driver of the Ford was transported to Overlake Hospital with minimal injuries.

Stygar remained unharmed in the accident. Officers found out that he was driving too fast for road conditions. Westbound Interstate 90 was shut down for more than three hours as crews worked at the scene. No other details are immediately available.

The crash remains under investigation.
