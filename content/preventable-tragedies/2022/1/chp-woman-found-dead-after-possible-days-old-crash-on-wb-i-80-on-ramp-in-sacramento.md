SACRAMENTO, Calif. — A woman was found dead after a solo crash on a westbound Interstate 80 on-ramp in Sacramento Tuesday morning, but investigators say the crash may have happened days ago.

The California Highway Patrol said the 19-year-old woman from Woodland hit a tree at freeway speeds on the West El Camino Avenue on-ramp to get onto westbound Interstate 80. She was the only person inside the vehicle, officials said.

The crash was not visible from the roadway, so authorities said it’s unclear when the crash happened.

However, officials told KCRA 3 it was likely not Tuesday morning, and it may have been days ago.

The identity of the woman has not yet been released.

This is a developing story.
