WILLIAMSON COUNTY, Tenn. (WKRN) – One man is dead after a semi-truck crashed into his car overnight on I-65 in Williamson County.

The crash happened Wednesday just after midnight in the northbound lanes of I-65 ahead of the Moores Lane exit near mile marker 69.

According to Tennessee Highway Patrol, a 2005 Nissan Murano was stalled in lanes of traffic on I-65 with no light indicators on.

Officials say that’s when a semi-truck traveling on I-65 rear-ended the Nissan Murano killing 59-year-old Edem Attih, of Brentwood.

The northbound lanes of I-65 have now reopened for travel after being closed for nearly four hours early Wednesday morning.
