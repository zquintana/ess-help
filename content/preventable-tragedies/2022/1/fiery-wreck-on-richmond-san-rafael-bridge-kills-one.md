Authorities are investigating a fatal wreck that closed eastbound Interstate 580 on the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.

The crash occurred at 7 p.m. Wednesday when a sedan stopped in the right lane, said Officer Darrell Horner of the California Highway Patrol. A big rig crashed into the sedan, and both vehicles caught fire.

The occupant of the sedan died, and coroner’s investigators did not release the person’s name on Thursday.

The truck driver reported no injuries, Horner said.
