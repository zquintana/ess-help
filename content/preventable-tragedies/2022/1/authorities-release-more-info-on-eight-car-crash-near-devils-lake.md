DEVILS LAKE â€” A chain-reaction accident on Friday, Jan. 21, involving eight vehicles on a bridge on Highway 57 at mile-marker 12.5 near Devils Lake resulted in five people being transported to the hospital, according to Sgt. Jeff Bauske of the North Dakota Highway Patrol.

All who were transported had minor injuries and were released the same day, and no life flights were necessary, Bauske said. There were no fatalities, the vehicles' speeds were low, and alcohol consumption was not an issue "that we're aware of," he said.

The accident began with a Ford Explorer that had spun out and stalled on the bridge, according to an NDHP news release sent Monday, Jan. 24. The driver of a Chevrolet Silverado stopped to assist the stalled motorist. A Ford Expedition then struck the rear of the Silverado, which pushed it into the stalled Explorer. Then, a Toyota Scion also struck the Silverado. The stalled Explorer was struck by a Kia Optima, which was struck by a GMC Sierra.

A secondary crash occurred when a Toyota Camry struck the stalled Explorer, and another secondary crash occurred when a Pontiac G6 struck the Scion involved in the initial crash, the release said.

Weather was a key factor in the mishap, as strong winds from the north and northwest created zero visibility, he said.

Highway 57 in the area of the crashes was closed to motor vehicle traffic for around two and a half hours for crash scene investigation and clean up.
