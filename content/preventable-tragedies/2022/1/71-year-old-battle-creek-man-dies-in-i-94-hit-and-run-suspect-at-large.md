CHARLESTON TOWNSHIP, Mich. — A 71-year-old man from Battle Creek is dead after what state troopers are calling a hit-and-run crash on I-94 Tuesday night.

Michigan State Police says the crash happened in Charleston Township near mile marker 87.

We’re told the victim’s pickup truck was stopped along the right shoulder after the driver encountered vehicular difficulties. Authorities say another vehicle side-swiped the pickup while the victim stood outside. The force of the impact shoved the pickup into the driver, killing him, MSP explains.

The driver of the second vehicle did not stop at the crash site, troopers say.

Descriptions of the suspect and vehicle are unavailable at this time.

MSP says the vehicle should have black paint transferred from the victim’s pickup with damage along the front side, possibly closer to the passenger’s side.

The crash is currently under investigation.

Those with information regarding the suspect’s identity and/or vehicle are urged to get in touch with state troopers at 269-657-5551.

The crash closed the eastbound lanes on I-94 for several hours after the crash, according to the Kalamazoo County Consolidated Dispatch Authority. We’re told all lanes have since reopened.
