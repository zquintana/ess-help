RENO COUNTY â€” One person died in an accident just before 10p.m. Monday in Reno County.

The Reno County Sheriff's office reported a 2018 Ford Ecosport driven by 81-year-old Harold Zerger of Moundridge was southbound on Yoder Road at Trails West. He may have suffered a medical problem causing him to travel at a very slow speed or stop in the roadway.

A pickup driven by a 17-year from Mount Hope rear-ended the Ford.

Fire and EMS extricated Zerger from the vehicle and transported him to Hutchinson Regional Medical Center in critical condition.  He was later transported to St Francis Hospital in Wichita where he died. The teen driver was not seriously injured and released to his parents. Zerger was not wearing a seat belt, according to the Reno Co. Sheriff.
