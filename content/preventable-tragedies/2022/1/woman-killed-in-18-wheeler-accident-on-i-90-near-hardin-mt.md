title: "Woman Killed in 18-Wheeler Accident on I-90 near Hardin, MT"
---
Hardin, MT -- January 24, 2022, a 79-year-old woman was killed in a collision with a tractor-trailer on Interstate 90 near Hardin.

Authorities say the incident happened around 1:30 a.m. along eastbound I-90 near mile marker 490. Preliminary investigation suggests the victim was driving a Honda CR-V east on the roadway when she drifted into the median for unknown reasons. She reportedly over-corrected and crossed through the eastbound lanes before exiting the right side of the road. It then rolled over and came to rest back in the eastbound driving lane where it was hit moments later by a commercial 18-wheeler.

The victim, allegedly not wearing a seat belt, was ejected from her vehicle and suffered fatal injuries. No other injuries were reported.

The investigation continues but police say impaired driving and excessive speed do not appear to be factors.

No further information is available at this time.
