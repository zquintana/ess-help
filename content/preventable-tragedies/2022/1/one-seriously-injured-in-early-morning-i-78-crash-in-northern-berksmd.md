Troopers say tractor-trailer rear-ended disabled car.

A man was rushed to Reading Hospital with life-threatening injuries early Sunday morning after his disabled car was rear-ended by a tractor-trailer on Interstate 78 in Bethel Township, state police at Hamburg said.

Troopers gave this account:

A car occupied by a man from Spring Valley, N.Y., was stopped in the shoulder along the eastbound highway near mile marker 14.6, partially blocking the right lane. The vehicle was hit from behind by a truck driven by a man from Knoxville, Tenn., at about 2 a.m.

The car then struck an embankment, and the driver was ejected from the vehicle. He was believed to have been sitting in the front passenger seat when the crash occurred. The truck also struck the embankment and partially overturned.

The man who was in the car was taken to the hospital. Information on his condition was unavailable Sunday. The truck driver was treated on the scene for lacerations to his hands.

Troopers said the investigation is ongoing and requested the publicâ€™s help. Anyone who may have witnessed the crash is being asked to call state police at 610-562-6885 and reference incident number PA2022-91263.
