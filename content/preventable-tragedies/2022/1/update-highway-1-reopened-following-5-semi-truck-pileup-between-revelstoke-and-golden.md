UPDATE: Highway 1 east of Revelstoke has reopened following the semi pileup earlier this morning (Jan. 18)

The Trans Canada Highway is now fully open in both directions between Sicamous and Golden.

Highway 1 is closed in both directions between Revelstoke and Golden due to a vehicle collision which involved five semi trucks and one flagging contractor truck according to the Revelstoke RCMP.

The multi-vehicle collision occurred at approximately 5:00 a.m. on Jan. 18, roughly 10-15 km’s east of Revelstoke according to the RCMP.

The RCMP said that the first of the five semi’s lost control heading west on Highway 1 and jackknifed across the road, causing the second semi to do the same and collide with the first. The third semi managed to maintain control of the vehicle only until the fourth semi hit it. The fifth semi careened into a ditch.

According to reports from the Revelstoke RCMP, one of the semi drivers indicated that the roads were icy, with a thick layer of ice having formed on the highway after being closed for an extended period of time for avalanche control the night before.

No injuries were reported at this time and no charges have been made.

“Drivers need to slow down for changing road conditions. The flagger is OK but sore still on site working,” wrote Emcon Services on Facebook.
