ORLANDO, Fla. â€“ A man pushing a disabled SUV on State Road 417 in Orange County was fatally struck when a tour bus hit him and the vehicle early Tuesday, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

The wreck happened around 5:50 a.m. on southbound SR-417 at mile marker 6 near International Drive. SR-417 south was closed at John Young Parkway for most of the morning, but most lanes reopened around 9:45 a.m., officials said.

Troopers said a Chevrolet Tahoe became disabled in the right lane of the highway. A 30-year-old Orlando man was pushing the vehicle when a tour bus traveling in the right lane struck the back of the Tahoe and hit the man, causing the vehicle to then hit a guardrail.

The man was pronounced dead on scene, the FHP said.

A 28-year-old woman and two boys, ages 3 and 4, in the SUV were taken to the hospital and are in stable condition.

The bus driver, a 56-year-old Kissimmee woman, was not injured, according to the FHP.

The crash remains under investigation.
