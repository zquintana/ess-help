ISLAND PARK, Idaho (KLIX)-Authorities say there were no serious injuries in a 40 car pile-up Friday afternoon near Island Park in East Idaho. According to the Fremont County Sheriff's Office, at around 3 p.m. U.S. Highway 20 north of Island Park had to be shut down because of blowing snow that reduced visibility. The sheriff's office said multiple law enforcement and first responders from Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana assisted with the crash. The investigating agency, Idaho State Police, said a car had stopped in the roadway because of the low visibility and was hit by a semi-truck that resulted in a chain reaction. State Highway 87 and 32 had to be closed down as well because of weather conditions Friday.
