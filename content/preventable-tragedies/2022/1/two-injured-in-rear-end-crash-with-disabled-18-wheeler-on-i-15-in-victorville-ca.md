Victorville, CA -- January 10, 2022, a woman and a child were injured in a rear-end collision with a disabled tractor-trailer on Interstate 15 in Victorville.

Authorities say the incident happened just after 2:00 p.m. on southbound I-15 near the Stoddard Wells Road off-ramp. Preliminary investigation suggests a commercial 18-wheeler was pulled onto the shoulder of the roadway in the area while the driver changed a tire. He told investigators that as he worked on the tire a red sedan approached from the road and crashed into the back of his truck's trailer.

A woman and young child in the sedan were airlifted from the scene to area hospitals for treatment of serious injuries.

The investigation continues. No further information is currently available.
