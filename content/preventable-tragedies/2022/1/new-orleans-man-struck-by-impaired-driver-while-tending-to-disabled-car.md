NEW ORLEANS —

Louisiana State Police are investigating a fatal crash that happened Friday morning in New Orleans.

Around 3:30 a.m. troopers responded to a two-vehicle crash on the U.S. 90B elevated near Barataria Boulevard.

This crash killed 83-year-old Curtis Williams of New Orleans, according to state police.

Troopers say Williams was tending to a disabled 2005 Chrysler Pacifica in the right lane of the elevated portion of the highway with emergency flashers on.

Williams was standing on the driver’s side near the back of the Chrysler when a 2014 Nissan Altima, driven by 36-year-old Adrian Major, struck the back of the Chrylser. The Nissan also hit Williams, according to troopers.

Williams later died at a hospital.

Major had minor injuries, and troopers determined that Major was impaired and he was placed under arrest.

Major was booked into the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center for vehicular homicide, careless operation and operating a vehicle with a suspended driver’s license.
