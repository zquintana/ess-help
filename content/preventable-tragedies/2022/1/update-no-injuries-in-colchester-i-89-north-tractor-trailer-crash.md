Vermont State Police said on Saturday that strong winds caused Friday night’s crash on Interstate 89 north in Colchester.

A Plattsburgh man pulled over into the breakdown lane and called for help about a half-mile south of Exit 17 when his van overheated. Shortly before 9:00 p.m., while he was waiting for help to arrive, police said a Quebec man driving a tractor trailer lost control of his rig due to the wind. A witness reported seeing him try to avoid the crash, but the semi driver rear-ended the van.

There were no injuries and no charges had been filed as of Saturday night, but troopers are still investigating what happened. They’re asking you to call the VSP Williston barracks at (802) 878-7111 if you saw anything.
