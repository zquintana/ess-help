A Wildomar man was killed when his car plowed into the back of a big rig stopped on the right shoulder of the 15 Freeway in Lake Elsinore on Friday night, Jan. 28, the California Highway Patrol said.

Around 9:15 p.m., a Honda Accord was heading south on the freeway at approximately 60 mph. A big rig with a trailer in tow was stopped along the right shoulder of the freeway south of Franklin Street. The driver had stopped his truck and trailer to inspect an unusual noise coming from the rear of the trailer, authorities said.

About 15 to 30 seconds after the truck stopped, the Honda Accord, for an unknown reason, veered onto the right shoulder and struck the rear of the trailer, crushing the car and trapping the driver, according to the CHP.

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. He was identified by the coroner as Rafael Marchan, 29.

The truck driver was not injured.

The crash is still under investigation.
