All lanes re-opened after crash closed interstate at San Pablo Dam Road for about three hours

One man died Sunday morning in a crash that shut down Interstate 80 in San Pablo.

The crash happened about 6:15 a.m. when a white van going east on I-80 near the San Pablo Dam Road exit lost control and hit the center divide wall, according to the California Highway Patrol. Three other vehicles then hit the van.

A man in one of those three vehicles was pronounced dead on the scene. His name has not been released, pending notification of next of kin.

Two other people were hospitalized with serious injuries, the highway patrol said. Their conditions were not immediately available.

The crash is under investigation. The crash closed the interstate for about three hours, but all lanes re-opened around 9:30 a.m.
