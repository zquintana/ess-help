ELKHART COUNTY, Ind. -- A man who was working on his trailer on the side of the road was injured when another vehicle rear ended the trailer, causing it to overturn onto him, according to the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies were called to CR 38 just west of CR 41 just before 5:30 Wednesday morning for a two vehicle crash.

Reports say Brent Hershberger parked his truck and trailer on the side of the road on CR38 and the driver began working on the trailer.

A driver in an SUV who was headed eastbound on CR38 rear ended the trailer, reports said.

The trailer then fell onto Hershberger, pinning his legs, reports said.

Hershberger was taken to the hospital via helicopter for treatment of fractures to both legs.

The driver of the SUV told deputies she didn’t see the trailer in time and rear ended it, according to deputies.
