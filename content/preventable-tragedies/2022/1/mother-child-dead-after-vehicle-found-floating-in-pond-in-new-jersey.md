title: "Mother, child dead after vehicle found floating in pond in New Jersey"

PISCATAWAY, New Jersey (WABC) -- Authorities are investigating after a mother and her child died after their vehicle went into a pond in New Jersey.

The incident was reported near Stelton Road and Lakeview Avenue around 5:30 a.m. Tuesday.

Crews responding to the scene found a vehicle floating in New Market Pond with two people inside -- a mother and her 9-month-old child.

The two individuals, later identified as Tameka Robinson and her son Noah, were pronounced dead at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.

Security cameras that police are reviewing suggest that the vehicle went off the road and plunged into the water hours before the crash was reported.

The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office is investigating. There are many questions left to be answered about how the SUV jumped a pretty high curb, made an almost 90-degree turn and plunged into the water.

Investigators haven't figured out what caused the crash, but the 30-year-old victim's mother says her daughter was depressed and she asked her not to take the baby out.

"I think my daughter was dealing with depression and she didn't want help," Lilian Robinson said.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Joe Naccarato of the Piscataway Police Department at (732) 562-1100 or Detective Paul Kelley of the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office at (732) 745-3330.

If you or someone you know is in crisis and in need of someone to talk to, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.
