One person has died after a serious crash this afternoon.

According to State Police Association of Massachusetts, just after noon earlier this afternoon, members assigned to the State Police-Foxboro Barracks responded to a crash on Route 1 Southbound in Sharon.

When Troopers arrived on scene, they discovered a Ford Escape fully engulfed following a multi-vehicle crash involving a tractor trailer and pickup truck.

The facts and circumstances of the crash remain under investigation by Troop H Detectives of the Massachusetts State Police along with the State Police Collision Analysis Reconstruction Section, and Crime Scene Services Section.
