A man who was tragically hit by a lorry in the aftermath of a crash on the A1 has been named as a 29-year-old from Bolton.

Police say Nathan Thomas Morris, from Farnworth, was 'struck and killed by a lorry' after getting out of his own vehicle on the major road through Cambridgeshire.

Emergency services raced out to the A1, near Sawtry, at around 7am on Monday (January 17) following reports of a serious crash.

Cambridgeshire Police says Mr Morris had got out of his Ford Fiesta on the northbound carriageway after it had hit the central reservation.

The force says Mr Morris, of Plodder Lane, was then hit by a lorry on the road.

Another driver suffered minor injuries in what police describe as a 'linked collision' between a BMW 1 Series and a Nissan Leaf.
