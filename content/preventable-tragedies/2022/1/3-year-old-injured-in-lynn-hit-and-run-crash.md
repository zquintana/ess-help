title: "3-Year-Old Injured in Lynn Hit-and-Run Crash"

A child was hit by a car in a hit-and-run crash Thursday night in Lynn, Massachusetts, leaving him with non-life-threatening injuries, police said, and the search is on for the driver.

Both Lynn police and Massachusetts State Police could be seen investigating in the area of 18 Bulfinch Street around 9 p.m. Thursday.

A witness, who did not want to be identified, said the 3-year-old and his mother were visiting her when he was hit. She said the two were leaving around 9 p.m. and standing by their car when the crash happened. The little boy has a broken leg and nose.

"He was about to get in the car when the other vehicle passed really fast, hitting him," the witness said through a translator.

Police are canvassing the neighborhood for surveillance footage that might show the vehicle. The driver took off after the crash, according to police.

"We didn't see plates or anything because we were focusing on the child.  We just saw him getting hit by the car.  We were in shock," the witness said.

Neighbors heard the commotion.

"Somebody screaming and crying.  But by the time I got to the window the first cops showed up," Maria Santiago, who lives nearby, said.

They said the street is normally safe, but that sometimes people drive too fast.

"I have grandkids and I'm always telling my daughter make sure you hold their hands, hold their hands because sometimes people drive through like they're crazy around here," Santiago said.

An investigation is ongoing.
