A 37-year-old woman was seriously injured early Friday when she was struck by a hit-and-run driver while she was changing a tire on the shoulder of a Denton highway, Denton police said. The woman was taken to a local hospital with what Denton police said were injuries that were not life threatening. Denton police asked for help to find the hit-and-run driver, who was driving a white sport utility vehicle, possibly a 2007-2014 Chevrolet Tahoe or Yukon. The SUV is missing its passenger side mirror and housing.
