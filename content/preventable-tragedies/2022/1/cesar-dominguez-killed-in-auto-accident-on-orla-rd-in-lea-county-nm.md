title: "Cesar Dominguez Killed in Auto Accident on Orla Rd in Lea County, NM"
---
Lea County, NM -- January 6, 2022, 37-year-old Cesar Gutierrez Dominguez was struck and killed by a pickup truck along Orla Road in Lea County.

Authorities say the incident happened shortly before 11:45 p.m. along Orla Road south of Royce Lane. Preliminary investigation suggests a commercial tractor-trailer became stuck in the dirt on the roadway, blocking both traffic lanes. Reports indicate a number of motorists including Dominguez stopped to help the truck driver.

Dominguez was reportedly standing behind the commercial truck's trailer when a southbound driver, initially unable to see the semi-truck ahead, had to swerve to avoid crashing into it. The driver's Chevy Silverado pickup instead hit Dominguez in the roadway.

Dominguez was transported to a hospital in Kermit, TX, where he was pronounced dead.

The investigation continues. No further information is currently available.
