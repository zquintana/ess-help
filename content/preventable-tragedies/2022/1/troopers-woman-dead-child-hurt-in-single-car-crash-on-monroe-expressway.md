UNION COUNTY, N.C. — The North Carolina Highway Patrol is investigating a deadly crash 

that happened on the Monroe Expressway Tuesday morning.

Troopers said they were called just after 7:45 a.m. to the eastbound side of the bypass, 

near Unionville-Indian Trail Road. They said they found a woman who had been thrown from 

a car and died. A second person, a child, was taken to the hospital with a cut to their 

head, troopers said.

The woman was later identified as Morgan Marie Futch, 27, from Wingate.

According to Highway Patrol, the crash is believed to have happened overnight, at about 

1:30 a.m. Troopers said the car was found down a ditch and it’s possible it was not 

spotted until the morning.

All the eastbound lanes of the expressway were blocked temporarily while troopers 

investigated the crash.

Troopers believe Futch was speeding and said that contributed to the crash. They said she 

was driving east on the bypass when she ran off the right side of the road and collided 

with the embankment. She was thrown from the car, troopers said.
