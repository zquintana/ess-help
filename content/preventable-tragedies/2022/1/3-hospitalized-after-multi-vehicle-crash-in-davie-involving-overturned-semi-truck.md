DAVIE, FLA. (WSVN) - A multi-vehicle crash on the Florida Turnpike in Davie caused a semi-truck to overturn, led to hours-long road closures and sent three people to the hospital, officials said.

Florida Highway Patrol and Davie Fire Rescue units responded to the scene of the crash along the northbound lanes of the Turnpike, near Mile Marker 54, just after 5 a.m., Saturday.

Investigators said the crash involved a semi-tractor trailer, a small box truck and a passenger vehicle. One crash led to another.

FHP said the box truck hit the tan sedan. The driver of the tan sedan, taking up a center lane of traffic, tried to turn around and headed the wrong way into incoming traffic.

The driver of the semi-truck, Sharmarke Saeed, described what happened next.

“I had to think quick and tried to avoid him,” he said.

Saeed said he swerved in order to avoid the sedan but lost control of his truck.

“I saved his life, and I’m a bit frightened,” he said.

Authorities said the 18-wheeler flipped over on its side, nearly rolling over the New River Bridge.

Officials said the collision left the semi-truck’s tail end hanging over the edge of the bridge.

The driver who attempted to make the U-Turn was transported to Broward Health Medical Center with injuries that were not life-threatening.

Two other patients were transported in unknown conditions, but FHP said they were taken away from the scene with injuries that were not serious.

Troopers shut down all northbound lanes near the scene of the crash and the northbound entrance ramp from eastbound Interstate 595. Traffic was diverted to I-595 from the Turnpike while the scene was cleared.

Officials said a towing company responded and used a crane to upright the semi-truck.

All northbound lanes on the Turnpike reopened to traffic Saturday afternoon.
