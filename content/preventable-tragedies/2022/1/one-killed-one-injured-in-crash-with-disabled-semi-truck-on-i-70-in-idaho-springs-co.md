Idaho Springs, CO -- February 2, 2022, one person was killed and another was injured when a Jeep collided with a disabled semi-truck on Interstate 70 in Idaho Springs.

Authorities say the incident happened around 5:30 p.m. on eastbound I-70 near exit 241. Preliminary investigation suggests a commercial semi-truck was broken down on the shoulder of the road when a Jeep Compass Trailhawk approached from the west and, for unknown reasons, crashed into it.

The Jeep's passenger, a 33-year-old woman, was pronounced dead at the scene. Its driver was transported to an area hospital for treatment of unspecified injuries. The truck driver, in the cab at the time of the collision, was unhurt.

Police continue to investigate but say no signs of impairment were found. No further information is currently available.
