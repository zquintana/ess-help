title: "Maryland Man Killed On Florida Highway When Driver Hits Three People On The Road Shoulder"
---
A 52-year-old Maryland man was killed in a crash that happened on I-75 in Tampa on Wednesday around 5:24 pm.

According to Florida Highway Patrol, an SUV driven by a 19-year-old Michigan man was traveling southbound on I-75, south of Bruce B Downs Boulevard, in the outside lane. 

The Maryland man was stopped in his car on the southbound outside shoulder of I-75, with a pickup truck stopped on the shoulder just ahead of the car. 

Investigators say the occupants of the car and pickup truck were standing outside of the vehicles when the Michigan man failed to negotiate a curve in the roadway. 

Troopers say the SUV entered the outside shoulder and collided with both stopped vehicles and the occupants of both vehicles. 

Transported to an area hospital, the 52-year-old Maryland man died from injuries suffered during the crash. 

Two men from Ruskin, Florida, ages 25 and 33, were injured in the crash, one serious.
