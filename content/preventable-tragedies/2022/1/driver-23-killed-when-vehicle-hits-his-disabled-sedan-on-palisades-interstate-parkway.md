A 23-year-old driver from Northvale was killed when his disabled car was struck by another overnight Monday on the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Alpine, authorities said.

The victim's 2002 Honda Civic was stopped in the fast lane of the northbound highway about a mile before Exit 4 in Alpine when it was struck by a 2021 Subaru shortly before 2 a.m., PIP Police Detective Sgt. First Class Raymond E. Walter said.

Police conducted CPR but the victim was pronounced dead at the scene, Walters said.
