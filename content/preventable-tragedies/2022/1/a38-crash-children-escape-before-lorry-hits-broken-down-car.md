---
Police have praised a woman who got two children out of a broken-down car before it was hit by a lorry.

Officers said the woman did "the right thing" by getting herself and the children out of the car and behind the barrier on the A38 in Derbyshire.

A lorry then crashed into the back of the vehicle, the Derbyshire roads policing unit said on Twitter.

Derbyshire Police said no-one was injured in the collision near Alfreton on Tuesday evening.

The force also confirmed no arrests had been made.
