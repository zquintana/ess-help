TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (WTWO/WAWV) — The passing lane of US-41 near the intersection of East French Drive was shut down for around an hour Wednesday night after a disabled vehicle was rear ended, Indiana State Police Sgt. Matt Ames said.

The road was shut down after a disabled vehicle was hit while stopped on US-41, Ames said. While traveling northbound on US-41, a driver’s car became disabled and the driver stopped in the passing lane, turning on the vehicle’s emergency hazard lights.

According to Ames, another oncoming driver did not see the hazard lights on the disabled vehicle and hit the rear end of the car.

One person was injured in the crash, Ames said. They were then taken to a local hospital referencing pain in their hands, Ames said.
