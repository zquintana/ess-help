A Philadelphia man was seriously injured after he was struck by a vehicle while working on a disabled car in Bristol Township.

This week, Pennsylvania State Police released information on the hit-and-run crash that occurred on I-95 just before the Bristol exit in on New Yearâ€™s Day around 12:48 a.m.

Troopers said the 27-year-old Philadelphia man was working on a disabled vehicle and standing partially in the left lane of travel. At that time, the man was struck by an unknown vehicle.

The pedestrian was thrown about 15 feet forward and landed on the left shoulder and also in the left lane of the highway, state police said.

The striking vehicle did not stop and left the scene, state police said.

Bensalem EMS transported the injured man to Jefferson Torresdale Hospital in Philadelphia for treatment for serious injuries.
