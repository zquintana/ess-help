Wichita, KS -- January 14, 2022, a 6-year-old girl was killed in a collision with a parked semi-truck on the shoulder of the Kansas Turnpike in Wichita.

Authorities say the incident happened around 8:25 a.m. on the turnpike (Interstate 35). Preliminary investigation suggests 28-year-old Tori Hornecker was traveling south on the highway in a Dodge Durango when she lost control for reasons not given in reports. The SUV left the roadway and crashed into the rear-left quarter of a parked Peterbilt semi-truck's trailer.

The 6-year-old was ejected in the crash and suffered fatal injuries. Hornecker and an 8-year-old boy in the Dodge were transported to a Wichita hospital for treatment of suspected serious injuries. The truck driver was unhurt.

No further information is available at this time.
