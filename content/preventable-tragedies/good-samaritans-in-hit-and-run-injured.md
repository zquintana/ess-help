title: "Good Samaritans in Hit and Run â€“ Injured"
---
One person is in custody after an incident late Wednesday morning where three people were injured after a hit and run.

Regina Police say they were sent to the intersection of Arcola and Victoria Avenues shortly before lunch and early information indicated a driver stopped at the intersection, then was struck by another driver from behind. The driver in the front vehicle then exited his vehicle and as he approached the rear of his vehicle, he was struck by the stolen vehicle.

Other vehicles, with occupants who witnessed the man in distress, stopped and got out of their vehicles to assist the victim. The suspect then struck the original victim and two witnesses who were assisting the injured man before fleeing the scene.

The name of the person in custody has not been released. Regina Police say their investigation continues and charges are anticipated.
