STANISLAUS, CA, (March 03, 2021) - A mother and her 9-year-old daughter tragically lost their lives on Wednesday, Feb. 3 when the vehicle they were passengers in was hit by a box truck along Interstate 5. The victims were identified by the Stanislaus County Coroner's Office as Rael Verduzco, 30, and her daughter Erika Tineo-Verduczo. Both were Ontario residents.According to the California Highway Patrol, 25-year-old Daniel Vega was behind the wheel of a Toyota sedan. At around 1 p.m., Mr. Vega reportedly slowed the car after getting a flat tire and was pulling over to the center median.

CHP said Catarino Torres Jr., 27 of Modesto, was driving a box truck behind the Toyota. He “admitted to reaching for something within his truck and looked away momentarily,” a California Highway Patrol officer said. The truck subsequently hit the right-rear of the Toyota.

Sadly, Ms. Verduzco and her child succumbed to injuries from the crash.

Mr. Vega and a 4-year-old passenger sitting behind him in the vehicle were transported to an area hospital with injuries.

Torres was uninjured, the CHP reported.
