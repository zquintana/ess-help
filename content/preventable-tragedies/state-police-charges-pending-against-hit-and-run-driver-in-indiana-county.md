State police in Indiana County said charges are pending against the driver of a pickup truck that injured a motorist on Wednesday when it hit a disabled vehicle along the side of the road and fled.

The incident happened at about 10:40 p.m. along Route 422 in White Township after a 22-year-old was experiencing mechanical problems with his Chevrolet Cheyenne and pulled onto the shoulder, according to police.

As the driver was getting back into his vehicle, a black Dodge pickup truck swerved and struck the partially opened door.

The driver was transported by ambulance to a local hospital for treatment, police said.

Police said the driver of the pickup truck was found and interviewed by investigators on Friday. Officials didnâ€™t release any other details about the suspect.
