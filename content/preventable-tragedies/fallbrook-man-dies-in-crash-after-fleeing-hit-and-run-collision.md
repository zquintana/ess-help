FALLBROOK — Fallbrook man dies in crash after fleeing hit-and-run collision

A 52-year-old man died late Monday night after he ran his SUV into the back of a disabled truck, veered off a road in Fallbrook and then ran into a tree, authorities said.

The man, who was not identified, drove his Chevrolet Tahoe off Reche Road between Live Oak Park Road South and Green Canyon Road around 10:50 p.m.

He was not wearing a seat belt when he crashed into the tree, according to the California Highway Patrol. He died before he could be taken to a hospital.

About two to three minutes before the fatal crash, he had run his SUV into the back of a disabled Chevrolet 3500 truck that was stopped on East Fallbrook Street near Debby Street — about 1 1/2 miles away — and kept driving, according to CHP Officer Hunter Gerber.

No one was in the truck when it was hit, Gerber said.

When the SUV went off the road, it ended up in some brush. Heat from the engine sparked a small vegetation fire, North County Fire Protection District spokesperson Capt. John Choi said.

The vehicle ended up about 30 feet off the road, down a small embankment. The force of the impact sheared the oak tree in half, Choi said.

The driver’s name was not immediately released. Choi said he was a Fallbrook resident. The man was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.

The crash remains under investigation. CHP officers don’t know if drugs or alcohol were factors in the crash.

Authorities operated one-way traffic on Reche Road near the crash scene for about two hours before clearing the area.
