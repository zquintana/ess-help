Two people were seriously injured and two were moderately hurt in a Kearny crash Tuesday morning, authorities said.

A 2011 Mitsubishi Lancer struck a disabled tractor trailer just after 4 a.m. near Route 7 and Harrison Avenue, Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez said.

The 21-year-old driver, a Garfield man, and a second rear passenger, a 20-year-old male, are listed in stable condition. A 19-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man suffered life-threatening injuries, Suarez said.

All four occupants of the car were transported to University Hospital in Newark.
