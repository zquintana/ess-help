A 66-year-old San Jose man was struck and killed after getting out of his vehicle and trying to cross U.S. Highway 101 in San Martin in Santa Clara County early Wednesday morning, according to the California Highway Patrol.

The collision occurred around 5:30 a.m. on southbound Highway 101 south of San Martin Avenue.

The man had stopped his vehicle in the center divider and got out and began walking toward another vehicle stopped on the right-hand shoulder when a 58-year-old woman driving a 2012 Toyota Corolla struck and killed him, CHP officials said.
