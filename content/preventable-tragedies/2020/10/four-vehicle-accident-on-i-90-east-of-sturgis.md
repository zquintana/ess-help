STURGIS, S.D. — At around 8:29 a.m. Friday morning, there was a four-vehicle crash on I-90 at mile marker 34 one mile east of Sturgis.

A 2014 Ford Focus was westbound on I-90 and crashed into a guard rail on the median side where it became disabled in the passing lane. A 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan was westbound in the passing lane and came upon the Ford Focus, where it tried to merge into the driving lane, but a 2017 Ford Transit van, also in the passing lane, rear-ended a 2014 Toyota Tundra, which then hit the Caravan.

The Toyota overturned onto its driver’s side and slid into the ditch. The Transit van went off the roadway into the ditch as well, and the Caravan pulled onto the shoulder and stopped.The four drivers were the only occupants of the vehicles, and they were all wearing seat belts.

The male driver of the Caravan was not injured. The male drivers of the Transit van and the Tundra both received minor injuries, and were not transported to a hospital. The 40-year-old female driver of the Ford Focus suffered minor injuries, but was transported by ambulance to the Sturgis hospital.

Charges are pending against the female driver.

The South Dakota Highway Patrol investigated the crash, and they were assisted by the Meade County Sheriff’s Office, the Sturgis Police Department, and the South Dakota Department of Transportation.
