A Hardin County man was killed while helping a person involved in a traffic accident on Interstate 65 on Monday morning.

Officials got an initial call at 3:25 am about an accident near the 97-mile marker of I 65 north involving one vehicle, said Hardin County Deputy Coroner Shana Norton. 

The man killed was Michael Fizer, 48, of Hardin County, Norton said.

He stopped to help the person in the crash when he was struck by an oncoming vehicle.

Two semi trucks also collided when trying to avoid the first accident. The trucks sustained minimal damage.

The Kentucky State Police are investigating.

Fizer's family has been notified, and they were not surprised Fizer went out of his way to help someone else, Norton said. 

He was being a good Samaritan, she said.
