A 26-year-old Naperville man was killed Monday night in a three-vehicle crash on southbound Interstate 55.

The crash occurred at 6:23 p.m. just south of Lemont Road, according to the Illinois State Police.
A news release said Naperville resident Hunter G. Johnnic was driving a 2011 silver Volkswagen when he struck the rear of a 2012 gray Honda driven by Juan D. Castillo-Tobar, 23, of Bolingbrook. Johnnic's vehicle then became disabled in traffic and was struck by a 2017 gray Jeep driven by Mitchel R. Jacoby, 46, of Shorewood.
