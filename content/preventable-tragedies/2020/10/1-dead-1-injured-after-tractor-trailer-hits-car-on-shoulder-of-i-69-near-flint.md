CLAYTON TOWNSHIP, MI - One person is dead and another injured after an early morning crash on Interstate 69, just west of Flint.

Troopers from the Michigan State Police Flint post responded to the fatal crash involving a tractor-trailer on eastbound I-69 near M-13 in Clayton Township around 3:30 a.m. Monday, Oct. 26, MSP Lt. Liz Rich said.

A pickup truck had stopped on the side of the freeway after running out of gas. The driver and passenger were attempting to refuel the vehicle when the semi struck their vehicle, police said. The tractor-trailer jackknifed and ran off the roadway, Rich said.
The driver of the car, a 29-year-old Gratiot County man, was killed and the passenger, a 26-year-old Gratiot County man, was injured. The 26-year-old is in stable condition, according to the Clayton Township Police Department.

The semi driver was not injured.
