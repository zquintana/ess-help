---
Authorities say a Garden City man whose car broke down on I-75 was hit by two vehicles and killed as he tried to cross the freeway. 

The incident happened around 10:30 p.m. Thursday along northbound I-75 just south of Swan Creek Road in Berlin Township. 

The Monroe County Sheriff's Department says the 64-year-old victim left his disabled vehicle along the roadway and was walking across the freeway when he was struck by a Ford Explorer that was traveling in the center lane. 
The victim was then struck again by second Ford Explorer. He was declared dead at the scene. 

The other drivers, a 45-year-old Monroe woman and 42-year-old Taylor man, were not injured.
