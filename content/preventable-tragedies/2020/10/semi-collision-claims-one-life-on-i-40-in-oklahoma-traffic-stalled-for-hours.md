I-40 westbound lanes in eastern Oklahoma were blocked Wednesday morning following a fatal semi collision.

A semi heading westbound hit the back of the box truck pulled over on the shoulder, stopping their vehicle. Another semi then crashed into the back of the semi that hit the box truck, causing the roadway to be blocked.
