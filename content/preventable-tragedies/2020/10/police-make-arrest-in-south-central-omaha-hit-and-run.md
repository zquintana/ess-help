Omaha Police say 19-year old Carlos Gonzales of Omaha has been booked for leaving the scene of a personal injury collision after a person working on a disabled vehicle was hit by a car Sunday evening.

Investigators say 30-year old Reynold Reed was fixing a tire near 60th and F Streets when he was hit by a northbound Nissan Altima.

Police say warning lights were flashing on the car, and an orange traffic cone was in place.

Police say the Nissan continued northbound for approximately a hundred feet before the driver and a passenger fled on foot.

Reed was taken to a hospital with serious injuries by Omaha Fire Department medics.

Police later arrested Gonzales near 34th and Parker Streets.
