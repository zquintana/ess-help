AIKEN COUNTY, SC (WFXG) - Two people are dead in unrelated hit-and-run incidents along the highways.

According to the Aiken County Corner's Office, Irma V. Soto and her fianc√© were driving along Edgefield Hwy. on Friday, Oct. 9, when at about 10:59 p.m. they got off their truck at the 1400 block, near Sassafras Rd, to move an item that had fallen off their vehicle. 

It was then that a southbound sedan hit Soto and kept going without stopping.

Soto, 48, of Aiken was pronounced dead at the scene by the corner at 12:10 a.m.

South Carolina Highway Patrol is looking for any information about the driver, who was possibly in a Nissan. Officers don't have information about the model or color but they say the vehicle should have damages to its hood and the passenger side.
