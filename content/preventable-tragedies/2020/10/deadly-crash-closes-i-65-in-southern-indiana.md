SELLERSBURG, Ind. â€” State Police are investigating a deadly overnight crash on Interstate 65 in Scott County Saturday.

The crash occurred shortly after 4 a.m. between Henryville and Scottsburg, near the 26 mile marker on the northbound side of the highway, according ISP Sgt. Cary Huls. 

A Monroe Township Fire Department Facebook post described what authorities say led to the crash.A passenger car driven by Veronica McCall of Crothersville hit a deer and stopped on the shoulder. After she got out of the car, a semi going northbound hit her car and continued off the road and into the woods. The cab of the semi struck trees, pinning the driver, identified by police as 71-year-old Johnny G. Skarb of Wonder Lake, Illinois, in the truck. A Scott County coroner pronounced Skarb dead at the scene.
