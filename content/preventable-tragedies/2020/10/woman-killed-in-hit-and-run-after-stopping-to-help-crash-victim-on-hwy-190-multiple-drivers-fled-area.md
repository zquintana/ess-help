PORT ALLEN - A good Samaritan was struck and killed after she pulled over to help out another person involved in a crash overnight.

State police said Theresa Matherne, 57, of Baton Rouge was fatally struck after she stopped to help a driver involved in a crash on US 190 near LA 415 around 9:30 p.m. Thursday.

Investigators said Matherne was walking in an eastbound lane when she was hit by multiple vehicles. The vehicles that struck Matherne then fled the scene.
