GENESEE COUNTY, Mich. (WJRT) - One person is dead and another was badly hurt following an early morning crash on I-69 in western Genesee County on Monday.

Clayton Township Police first got a call around 3 a.m. about a vehicle stopped in the eastbound lanes of I-69 near M-13. Shortly after, they got another call saying an accident happened in the same area.

Investigators believe a pickup truck had stopped on the freeway and one of the occupants was outside when it was hit by a semi-truck, which jack-knifed and ran off the road.

The pickup truck driver, a 29-year-old Gratiot County man, was killed. His passenger, a 26-year-old also from Gratiot County, was badly hurt. The semi-truck driver did not report any injuries.Michigan State Police say the Gratiot County men had run out of gas and were trying to refuel. Clayton Township police were still looking into the cause Monday evening, but officers said motorists should never exit a car on the side of the road.

Eastbound I-69 at M-13 was closed for several hours Monday morning while police investigated and cleared the scene.
