title: "Woman killed in accident near Cache Creek after hitting a deer"
---
A 21-year-old woman from the Central Interior was killed in an accident north of Cache Creek on the weekend.

It happened Saturday night just before 8 p.m. on Highway 97, near the junction with Highway 99. Police officers from Clinton and Ashcroft responded to the scene.

RCMP Traffic Services Cpl. Mike Halskov says a southbound vehicle lost all power after hitting a deer and was stuck in the southbound lane.

A woman was killed on impact when she was hit by her own car, after an oncoming vehicle hit the stopped vehicle at the full speed.

“Lighting conditions were certainly a factor, there’s no ambient street lighting in that area that could’ve helped illuminate things. Of course you’re travelling down the highway, one doesn’t expect to come across a vehicle completely disabled in their lane, no lights or anything. By the time you realize what’s happening of course it’s far too late,” he tells NL News.

Halskov says there were two other people in the car that hit the deer, and both were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The driver of the oncoming vehicle was taken to hospital with minor injuries.

All people involved were from the central Interior.

While calling it tragic, Halskov says this is not a criminal accident and no one will be charged. He says the investigation is ongoing.
