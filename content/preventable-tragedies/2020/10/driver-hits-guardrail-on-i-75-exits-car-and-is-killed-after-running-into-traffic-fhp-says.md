HOLLYWOOD, Fla. – A 31-year-old man died Saturday from being struck by a car when he ran into traffic minutes after his car hit a guardrail.

According to Florida Highway Patrol, the driver somehow lost control of the vehicle and collided with a guardrail before the car came to rest on the grass shoulder of the road. The driver was traveling in the express lanes of northbound I-75, just south of Sheridan Street (SR 822). The incident happened around 5:15 p.m.

The driver, for some unknown reason, then exited the vehicle and ran into the roadway’s lanes of traffic, where he was struck by a car. He was pronounced dead on the scene.

FHP is continuing its investigation. The victim’s name was not released. Two people in the second car were not injured.
