MILAN, Ohio (WJW) â€” The Ohio State Highway Patrol is investigating a fatal crash involving a pedestrian and a semi-tractor trailer on the Turnpike.

According to troopers, a 23-year-old woman was driving westbound on Thanksgiving when her vehicle struck a concrete median barrier before ending up in a ditch. The driver then got out of her car and walked into the westbound lanes of travel where she was hit by a semi.

The woman was pronounced dead on scene. The driver of the semi was not hurt.

Troopers said it is unknown if drugs or alcohol were a factor in the incident.
