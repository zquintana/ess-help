Two people were killed in a crash late Thursday night on the New Jersey Turnpike in Mercer County, authorities said.

A Lincoln Town Car crashed and was left disabled on the Turnpike at 11:53 p.m. in East Windsor, said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Lawrence Peele. A Jeep driving north then hit the disabled Lincoln, killing two passengers in the back seat, Peele said.

The two back seat passengers were pronounced dead at the scene, Peele said. The driver and front seat passenger in the Lincoln sustained serious injuries, he said. The driver of the Jeep suffered minor injuries, he added.Preliminary information indicates the Lincoln was disabled across the right and center lanes, Peele said.

The inner part of the road was closed for about six hours, and the crash is still under investigation, Peele said.
