title: "Woman killed in crash on Route 104 identified"

A woman was stuck and killed, and several other motorists were injured on Route 104 in Ontario, Wayne County, on Sunday evening.

Wayne County sheriff's deputies said that a car driven by Timothy Mannix, 57 of Marion, for an unknown reason, had stopped in the eastbound passing lane just before 7 p.m.

One driver, a 65-year-old Williamson man, stopped directly behind Mannix's car and  turned on his four-way flashers, deputies said. Multiple eastbound vehicles tried to stop but crashed into one another. 

One driver, 35-year-old Nicole Dipiazza of Marion, crashed into the guide rail and then exited her vehicle. She was struck by another oncoming car that also hit her vehicle, deputies said. Dipiazza was pronounced dead at the scene.

Two children in her vehicle — Dipiazza's 9-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son — were taken to Strong Memorial Hospital for treatment of minor injuries, deputies said. Two other involved drivers — the 65-year-old Williamson man and an 84-year-old Marion man — suffered minor injuries and were hospitalized overnight, deputies said.

It was not immediately known why Mannix stopped on the road, deputies said. His vehicle was not struck by any oncoming cars and he was not injured, however, he was taken to Strong Memorial Hospital for a blood draw "on suspicion of intoxication," deputies said in a news release.
