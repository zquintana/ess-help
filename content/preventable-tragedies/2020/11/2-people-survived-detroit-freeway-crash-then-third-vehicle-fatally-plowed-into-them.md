title: "2 people survived Detroit freeway crash — then third vehicle fatally plowed into them"
---
Two people who survived a collision between two cars along a Detroit freeway were struck and killed by a third vehicle as they stood next to their car on the freeway, state police said.

Michigan State Police said both people died instantly Sunday night when a vehicle struck them and their car after they exited it and were standing by it on the Lodge Freeway.

The victims' car was blocking the freeway's left southbound lane after colliding with another car that ended up along the freeway’s right shoulder, state police said in a statement.“The occupants of the vehicle in the left lane exited and were standing by their vehicle on the freeway,” the police agency said. “The driver of a passenger vehicle was southbound in the left lane and struck the previous vehicle and both of the passengers from the previous crash.”


Police did not release other details, including the victims’ names and ages but a medical examiner’s examination was expected.
