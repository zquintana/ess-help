title: "4-Car Pileup Closes Gandy Bridge Traffic For Several Hours"
---
PINELLAS, FL â€” There were no serious injuries but the Gandy Bridge was closed down for several hours Sunday following a four-vehicle pileup that included a Florida Highway Patrol cruiser.

At 12:10 p.m., a 49-year-old Brandon woman was driving west along the Gandy Bridge when she looked down at her GPS and failed to see an unmarked Florida Highway Patrol car, which was stopped behind a disabled car driven by a 26-year-old Tampa man, partially in the travel lane and emergency shoulder.

The Brandon woman's car hit the rear of the patrol car and began to overturn. The patrol car then crashed into the rear of the Tampa man's car. The impact then propelled the patrol car into a trailer towed by an SUV.
