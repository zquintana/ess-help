title: "National Guard soldier dies in I-95 crash while delivering Thanksgiving meals"
---
A Delaware Army National Guard soldier was one of two people killed in a crash on Interstate 95 near Newark late Wednesday night as she was delivering Thanksgiving meals to people in need.

Guard officials said Cpl. Erin Sasse, a member of the 153rd Military Police Company, had witnessed an initial crash and stopped to assist when her car was struck by another vehicle.

"The Delaware National Guard lost a true citizen soldier all too soon," Maj. Gen. Michael Berry, Delaware National Guard's Adjutant General, said in a prepared statement. "Our hearts go out to her friends and family during this difficult time, as we all are reeling from this tragic news."

Sasse, a champion Jiu Jitsu fighter who was about to be promoted to sergeant, is survived by her husband Randy and three children. The 153rd’s Family Readiness Group started an online fundraiser for her family, and has already collected more than $11,000.

"Cpl. Erin Sasse epitomized the best of Army values. She served with the 153rd Military Police Company, a highly respected unit of our Delaware National Guard," Sen. Chris Coons said in a prepared statement. "Erin's instinct to risk her own safety in slowing down to assist a disabled motorist on a dangerous interstate is a testament to her courage and her character. Her family, friends, and fellow soldiers knew her as a remarkable and incredibly caring person, and her tragic loss will be felt by many for years to come."

According to Delaware State Police, the crash happened around 10:40 p.m. near the Churchman's Road overpass. A 22-year-old man from North East, Md., was traveling north and lost control of his Honda Civic due to someone merging in front of him, hit a concrete barrier and came to a stop in the left lane. Another man, Lorenzo Deer, 29, of North East, pulled over and got out of his car to check on him.Deer was struck by a Kia Stinger that veered to avoid hitting the Honda. He landed on the interstate's left southbound lane, where another vehicle hit him.

At the same time, the Kia continued to travel out of control until it hit the back of Sasse’s car, pushing it into a concrete barrier.

Sasse was taken to Christiana Hospital, where she died. Deer died at the scene.

Other occupants of the vehicles involved suffered minor injuries or were not injured. Authorities said the crash remains under investigation.

Sasse is the second National Guard soldier to die in an I-95 crash near Newark in just over a month. On Oct. 18, Staff Sgt. Aubrey N. Mitsch, of the Maryland Army National Guard, was killed when another driver merged into the path of her motorcycle.
