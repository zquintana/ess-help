A woman was struck and died while walking across lanes of traffic on I-465 late Wednesday night.

About 11:30 p.m., emergency services responded to a scene with vehicles on the shoulder and a woman lying in the road on the westbound side of the highway, near Emerson Avenue on the southeast side, according to a release from the Indiana State Police. They said the woman was dead at the scene.

According to the initial police investigation, the woman left her disabled vehicle on the left shoulder and walked across all lanes of traffic to the other side; police don't know why. A vehicle, which didn't stop, struck her on her return trip, and then others hit her as she was lying in the road, the release stated. 

Indiana State Police continued to investigate early Thursday morning with help from the Indianapolis Fire Department, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, Indiana Department of Transportation and the Marion County Coroner's Office.
