MURRIETA — An 88-year-old woman was killed while standing outside a vehicle that was rear-ended on an Interstate 15 on-ramp in Murrieta.

The crash was reported at 9:45 a.m. Saturday on the Murrieta Hot Springs Road on-ramp to the northbound 15.

The California Highway Patrol said the woman was standing near the driver’s side of a 2014 Hyundai Sonata that was stopped on the on-ramp’s right shoulder before it was hit from behind by a BMW sedan.

The woman was struck by one of the vehicles and pronounced dead at the scene.
