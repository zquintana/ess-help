title: Teen Who Pulled Woman From Fiery Car Crash Recognized For Heroic Actions
---
DECATUR, Ind. (CBS Local) — An Indiana teenager is being hailed as a hero after saving a woman’s life following a fiery car crash.

Jeb Richey, 16, said he was riding in a car with his mom and some friends on U.S. 27 in Adams County on Aug. 3 when it screeched to a halt to avoid a driver stopped in the left lane.
“We were in the fast lane and they [the driver] were just stopped, not pulled off to the shoulder or into grass. They were just stopped in the middle of the left lane,” he told CBS affiliate WSBT.

Another driver on the road that day, Melissa Garmen, said could not stop in time. Her vehicle hit the car Richey was riding in and burst into flames.
