A woman who stopped to help a motorcyclist injured in a crash in Phoenix on Monday was hit by a car in the process, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety.

The incident involved a motorcycle, semi-truck and two cars on Interstate 10 near Buckeye Road, said department spokesperson Bart Graves.

The man driving the motorcycle was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries, said Graves.

A woman — who Graves described as a Good Samaritan — was believed to have been hit by a Toyota passenger car after it was hit by a semi, said Graves. She had stopped in the area to help the motorcyclist injured in a crash, he said.
