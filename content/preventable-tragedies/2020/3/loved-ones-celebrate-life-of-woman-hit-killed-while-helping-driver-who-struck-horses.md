According to the Highway Patrol report, a Toyota 4Runner was traveling south on U.S. 301 about 6:45 p.m. Feb. 27 when it hit two horses standing in the southbound lanes of the highway. The horses died from their injuries.

Nault was driving her Hyundai Genesis behind the Toyota and saw the crash. She stopped to help, got out of her car and started to walk over to the other driver.
But at the same moment, troopers said, a red Kia Forte that was also headed south on U.S. 301 hit one of the horses lying in the roadway, flipping the Kia, which hit Nault and her Hyundai. A 15-year-old girl was still inside the Hyundai when it was hit, and she survived.

According to Naultâ€™s husband, Robert, the 15-year-old was their daughter. She tried to save her mother, but Nault died at the scene.
