SAN JOSE — A 23-year-old man who was killed after getting out of his car on Highway 101 early Saturday morning has been identified.

San Jose resident Olman Aparicio Ayala, 23, was driving his 1997 Acura northbound near Interstate 880 when he got into a single-car crash around 5:40 a.m., according to California Highway Patrol.

Aparicio Ayala got out of his car and stood on the roadway, CHP said — at which point he was struck by two different cars, including a 2014 Dodge and a 2019 Chevy. The Chevy also rammed into a 1999 Lexus.

Emergency responders pronounced him dead at the scene.
