OAKLAND — A man who was just involved in a collision on Interstate 580 Tuesday night was killed by a  hit-and-run driver after getting out of his vehicle, the California Highway Patrol said Wednesday.

The man’s name has not yet been released.

The CHP said the man had been involved in a collision with another vehicle about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday on westbound I-580  just east of the Interstate 80 split, also known as the Berkeley curve.

The man got out of his vehicle and was in the roadway when he was struck by a  dark green van or dark green Ford F-150 truck that kept going, the CHP said.  He was pronounced dead at the scene.
