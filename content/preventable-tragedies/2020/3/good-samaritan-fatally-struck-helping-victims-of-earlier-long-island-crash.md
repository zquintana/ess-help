title: Good Samaritan fatally struck helping victims of earlier Long Island crash
---
A Good Samaritan who stopped to aid victims in a Long Island crash early Monday was fatally struck by another vehicle as she tried to help, police said.

The chaos began when a 2005 Toyota was rear-ended by a 2002 Toyota on Suffolk Ave. near Casement Ave in Islandia about 5:40 a.m., Suffolk County police said.
Jennifer Burgess, 36, stopped to help the motorists involved.

When two cars hit the newer-model Toyota, Burgess stepped into traffic to avoid that collision and wound up hit by a 2018 Honda, police said.
Burgess, who lived in East Setauket, was taken to Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, where she died.
