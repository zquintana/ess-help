title: Semi truck hits pedestrian on highway near Lashburn
---
A 35-year-old woman was reported in critical condition Monday after being hit by a semi truck Sunday evening.

Police said the woman was exchanging information with another driver around 6:30 p.m. on Sunday, after a collision on a stretch of Highway 16 just outside Lashburn, Sask.

An approaching semi was unable to swerve around the crash scene, hitting both vehicles and the woman, who was reportedly standing on the roadway at the time.

Maidstone paramedics brought the woman to hospital in Lloydminster; she was then taken by STARS air ambulance to Edmonton.

An RCMP media release noted visibility in the area was near zero at the time due to heavy snow and high winds.
