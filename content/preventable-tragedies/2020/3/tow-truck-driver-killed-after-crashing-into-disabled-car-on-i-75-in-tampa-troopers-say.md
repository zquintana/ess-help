TAMPA â€” A 36-year-old tow truck driver died Sunday after crashing into a disabled car on Interstate 75, authorities said.

Jason Lee Everitt of Thonotosassa was driving a 2017 International tow truck south on I-75 near the U.S. 301 overpass about 11 p.m. when he struck a 2006 Chevy Cobalt parked on the outside shoulder, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. After hitting the Chevy, the tow truck struck the guardrail and overturned down an embankment.

Everitt, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was thrown from the tow truck, troopers said. The truck came to rest on the grassy shoulder of U.S. 301. Everitt died at the scene.
