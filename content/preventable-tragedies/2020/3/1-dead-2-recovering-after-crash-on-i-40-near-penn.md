One person is dead and two others are recovering after a deadly crash on Interstate 40 near Pennsylvania Avenue Saturday night. 

Oklahoma Highway Patrol Troopers said 52-year-old Elizabeth Copeland was traveling westbound on I-40 when she hit the center barrier and stopped in the inside lane of the highway. A second vehicle then crashed into the first car. 

Copeland was pronounced dead at the scene, Troopers said. 

Two passengers were taken to OU Medical Center to be treated for their injuries. One of the victims was admitted in critical condition.
