---
An accident occurred late last week when a car crashed into a disabled tractor-trailer that was blocking both lanes of Hwy. 169. According to Sheriff Randall Tippins, his office received a call at 4:46 a.m. on March 19 regarding a disabled vehicle. While personnel from Evans County Sheriffâ€™s Office (ECSO) were on the scene, said Tippins, a car ran into the tractor-trailer.
