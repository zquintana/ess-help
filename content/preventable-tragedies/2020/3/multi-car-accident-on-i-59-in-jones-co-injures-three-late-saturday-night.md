ELLISVILLE, Miss. (WDAM) - Volunteer fire departments, along with the Jones County Sheriff’s Office and the Mississippi Highway Patrol, were on the scene of a multi-vehicle accident late Saturday night that injured three individuals.

Moselle, Union, and Southwest volunteer fire departments responded to the collision on Interstate 59 at the U.S. Highway 84 marker in the northbound lanes about 10:30 p.m. after the call came in as a five-car pile-up until first responders arrived to find only three vehicles involved.

From witnesses’ accounts, there were two separate incidents within moments of each other, with the first accident involving a Nissan Rough and a small pickup truck.

The Rouge was left down in the embankment on I-59 after the collision, and the pickup was left stranded in the middle of the northbound lanes with no functioning lights.

Shortly after the crash, a woman in an F-150 hit the pickup after not being able to see it until it was too late, moving the pickup to the shoulder of the interstate.
