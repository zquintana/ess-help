title: Woman killed after hit by multiple vehicles on I-24 near county line
---
A pedestrian was struck by multiple vehicles and killed early Sunday morning on Interstate 24 West, Nashville police said. 

The medical examiner's office is working with the victim's family to make a positive identification. 

According to preliminary reports, the victim had been driving her Nissan Versa east on I-24 near the Davidson-Rutherford County line prior to being struck. Her car reportedly had lost the driver's side tire, and she was driving on the rim "quite some time," police said. 

Her car then struck the guardrail on the right shoulder of eastbound I-24. 

A driver reportedly told police that they say a person laying on the left shoulder of the interstate who got up, jumped over the median wall and ran across the westbound lanes of traffic. 

After nearly being hit, the driver stopped and yelled to the victim, asking if she was alright. The victim waved to the driver and continued to run. 

At approximately 4:30 a.m. a 2017 Nissan Titan Pickup driven by Smyrna man struck the woman in the left lane, police said. Police said it appears that the victim was struck by additional vehicles, but those vehicles did not stop to assist. 

At the time of the crash, police said, the woman was only wearing one shoe. The matching shoe was found in her vehicle. Police said they also found her driver's license in the car.
