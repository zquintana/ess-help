Moments later, while on the shoulder, he was hit and killed by a pickup truck driven by a 31-year-old Bonita Springs man.

The pickup truck crashed into the initial crash site near the left lane.

The driver of the semi-truck was taken to Lee Memorial Hospital with traumatic injuries, according to investigators. Two people inside the car had to be extricated because it was wedged in-between the semi-truck and the pickup truck. They were taken to Fawcett Memorial Hospital.
