MOBILE, Ala. (WKRG) — Mobile Fire-Rescue Department says two are dead, one male and one female, in a crash between an 18-wheeler and another vehicle on I-65 between Airport and Government.

Witnesses on scene say they saw the 18-wheeler parked on the shoulder of the interstate since at least 9:30 Monday morning, without the emergency reflectors around the truck. One person was at work at Southeast Salvage Home Emporium when the crash happened, he said “The truck was stopped and when the car hit the truck the whole 18-wheeler moved. It was crazy the whole store walked outside because everybody heard it.”
