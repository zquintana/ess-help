title: "Man hit by car on Sniders Highway"
---
A 78-year-old Colleton County man was critically injured after he was struck by a car in the 700 block of Sniders Highway on Friday Dec. 11.
At 10:05 a.m., 9-1-1 began receiving multiple reports of the accident. It appeared the manâ€™s southbound Cadillac became disabled and stopped in the lane of traffic. The man exited his vehicle and walked to the front of the car when his vehicle was struck from behind by a southbound Dodge Challenger.
The impact caused heavy damage to both cars and pushed the Cadillac into the elderly man. He was thrown into the windshield and then to the ground.
Fire-Rescue units stationed a block away, arrived minutes later. Bystanders were administering first aid to the man. He was unconscious and suffered multiple traumatic injuries, including a head injury. Firefighter-paramedics quickly treated his injuries, immobilized him and transported him by ambulance to the Trauma Center at Trident Medical Center. No medical helicopters could fly due to light fog between Walterboro and Charleston.
The 69-year-old driver of the Challenger was evaluated for minor injuries and refused ambulance transportation to the hospital.
The Walterboro Police Department is investigating the crash.
