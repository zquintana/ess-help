BOYNTON BEACH â€” A 60-year-old Lake Worth Beach woman died early Sunday when a tractor-trailer struck her car on Florida's Turnpike just south of the Boynton Beach Boulevard exit, the Florida Highway Patrol said Monday.

The crash took place just after 5:15 a.m. in the southbound lanes at mile marker 86. Its cause remains under investigation, FHP said.The woman's sedan had stopped in the outside lane just before the tractor-trailer struck and partially ran over it, FHP said. The impact pushed both vehicles into the guard rail.

Paramedics pronounced the woman dead at the scene. FHP did not identify her, citing a policy it adopted this spring to withhold the names of crash victims from news releases.The agency modeled the policy on a 2018 amendment to the state constitution allowing crime victims, or their families, to ban public agencies from releasing their names.

The truck driver, a 48-year-old Miami man whom FHP also did not identify, sustained minor injuries. Both drivers wore seat belts. FHP said.
