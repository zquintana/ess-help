ORANGE, Texas â€” A pregnant woman and her baby were among five people killed in two separate crashes on I-10 in Orange County on Wednesday. 

Both wrecks involved 18-wheelers, and happened about two miles apart. 

A truck driver was killed Wednesday morning around 9:30 when his truck hit the rear end of another 18-wheeler that was broken down in the middle traffic lane of the interstate.

Troopers said Armas-Soler was ejected from the truck, which burst into flames. 

The person driving the broken down truck was not hurt.

Less than two hours later, about two miles east of the first wreck, a westbound SUV hit the rear end of an 18-wheeler stopped in traffic due to the first accident according to DPS. The driver of the SUV was pronounced dead at the scene by Orange County Justice of the Peace Chad Jenkins. He was a 50-year-old Fort Myers, Florida resident. 

A 29-year-old woman, also from Fort Myers, was riding in the front passenger seat of the SUV. She was taken to the hospital but did not survive her injuries. 

A 63-year-old Fort Myers resident was also riding in the vehicle. She was also pronounced dead at the hospital. 

Justice of the Peace Ben Collins told 12News one of the women was pregnant. Collins said medical staff worked to deliver and save her child, but the baby did not survive.
