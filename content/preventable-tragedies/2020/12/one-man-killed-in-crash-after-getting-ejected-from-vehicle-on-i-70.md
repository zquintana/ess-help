A man who was ejected from his vehicle was killed early Christmas morning after being struck by two vehicles on eastbound Interstate 70 near Byers in Arapahoe County.

The man was involved in a rollover crash after 12:30 a.m. near exit 314 before authorities believe he was ejected from his vehicle, said Mike Disher, chief of the Byers Fire Protection District. The crash is still under investigation.The victim, a 29-year-old man, was driving a Chevy pickup. After he was ejected, he was hit by a semi truck as well as another vehicle, said State Patrol Cpl. Ivan Alvarado. There were no other injuries.

Authorities have not released the identity of the victim.

Traffic in the area was diverted to U.S. 36 in Strasburg for several hours, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation. Crews cleaned up fuel that had leaked from the semi after it struck the driver, Alvarado said.
