LOUISVILLE, Ky. —
A 44-year-old man was killed late Sunday when he was struck by a vehicle on an exit ramp on Interstate 64 in west Louisville, police said.

James C. Shively, of Louisville, died of blunt force injuries in the incident reported around 11 p.m. Sunday, the Jefferson County Coroner's Office said in an update.According to the Louisville Metro Police Department, Shively was killed after he was involved in a crash on the I-64 exit ramp to Interstate 264.

Investigators said Shively was driving west on I-64 and, for reasons unknown, ran off the right shoulder as he was exiting the ramp to south I-264.

Shively's vehicle struck the guardrail and then overturned on its side, LMPD said. When he got out of his vehicle, Shively was struck by another car that was headed west on the exit ramp from I-64 to I-264.

Shively was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the car that struck Shively — and the driver's passenger — were taken to a hospital for minor injuries.

Additional details were not released, but the traffic unit is investigating.
