A woman was struck by a car and killed on Interstate 270 in Montgomery County on Monday morning after getting out of her own vehicle on a shoulder, the Maryland State Police said.

Kelly Elizabeth Vanaman, 34, of Frederick, Md. struck what was thought to be a chair on the Interstate about 10:30 a.m. and stopped on the left shoulder of the northbound lanes, near Interstate 370 North, the police said.

After getting out of her vehicle she walked towaerd another motorist who had parked on the shoulder after avoiding the debris.

At that time, police said a man swerved to avoid other vehicles that had slowed at the scene. His car hit the jersey wall on the left side of the road, and then struck Vanaman, the police said. He was taken to a hospital, they said.

Police said they are still investigating.
