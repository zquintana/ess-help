A portion of Interstate 24 Westbound near New Hope Road is reopening after a crash involving a semi shut the road down for hours Thursday morning.

The initial call came in around 3:50 a.m. and snarled morning rush hour traffic.

Officers on scene tell FOX 17 News that an SUV hit a semi that was pulled off on the side of the road. That SUV was then hit by a different semi that ended up overturning.

Officers say injuries are non-life threatening.

Crews remain on scene.
