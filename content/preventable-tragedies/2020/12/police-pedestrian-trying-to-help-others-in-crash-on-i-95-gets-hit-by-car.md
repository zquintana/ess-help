title: "Police: Pedestrian trying to help others in crash on I-95 gets hit by car"
---
Police say a pedestrian walking on the side of I-95 was hit by a car as he was trying to help others in a crash.
They say the pedestrian suffered minor injuries.
Reports say it happened overnight in Westport.
The good Samaritan apparently also got a verbal warning from police for “reckless use of the highway by a pedestrian.”
