A teacher at a St. Paul charter school was struck and killed by a passing driver Friday, according to the Minnesota State Patrol.

Alexa Hokeness, 29, of Lakeville, was a special-education teacher at the Hmong College Prep Academy.

At about 5 p.m. Friday, Hokeness was driving on state Highway 64 near the central Minnesota town of Motley. She stopped her car, got out and was in the northbound lane when hit by a car driven by Leland Baldwin, 69, of Ramsey.

Baldwin was not injured in the accident. A report by the State Patrol did not say why Hokeness left her car. Alcohol was not involved in the accident.On its website, the Hmong Academy mourned the death of a “beloved” teacher.

“It is with deep regret we must share with you that a tragic accident has claimed the life of one of our HCPA family, Lexi Hokeness, Special Education Teacher, on Friday evening. We have been in touch with her family and send our thoughts and prayers to them. This is an incredibly sad moment for our Special Education department, and for the HCPA family overall. As we grieve the loss of Lexi, we wanted to share with you specific resources to help our students and staff through this difficult time.”
