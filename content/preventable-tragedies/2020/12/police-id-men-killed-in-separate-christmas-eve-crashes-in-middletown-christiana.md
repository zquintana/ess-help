Later that night, another man, 34-year-old Bear resident David West, died while stopped on Route 1 north.

He had been driving on the highway, just south of the Interstate 95 overpass, when he lost control of his Honda Civic and hit a concrete barrier on the right shoulder of the road.

West got out of the car following the crash and was standing in the left lane when a 54-year-old woman from Townsend, who was also driving north, hit his Civic.

After hitting the Civic, the woman's car also hit West. He died on scene.

The woman was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries.
