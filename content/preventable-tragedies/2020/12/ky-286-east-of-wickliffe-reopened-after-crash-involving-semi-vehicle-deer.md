BALLARD COUNTY, Ky. (KFVS) - Both lanes of KY 286/Wickliffe Road, just east of Wickliffe in Ballard County reopened shortly after 1 a.m. following a crash Tuesday night.

According to Ballard County 911 Dispatch, a SEMI tractor trailer, a pick-up truck pulling a trailer and a deer were involved in a crash at approximately 9:30 p.m.

The Ballard County Sheriff’s Office said the driver of the SEMI, Nicolas Bedney, 37 of Humble, Texas, was traveling eastbound and hit a deer.

The SEMI then dropped off the right side of the roadway.

Bedney was unable to regain control of the rig and it crossed the roadway, hit the opposite ditch and flipped onto its side, which blocked both lanes of KY 286 near the Two Rivers Fisheries processing facility.

John Priest, 78 of Jackson, Missouri, was traveling westbound on KY 286 in a Dodge Ram pulling a trailer.

The sheriff’s office said Priest was unable to see the overturned SEMI and crashed into the roof of the box trailer.
