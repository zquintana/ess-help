An Oradell man was killed after he was struck by a car on Route 80 in Lodi on Wednesday night, authorities said. 

Edward Shindnes, 25, was a passenger of a Jeep that was stopped in the right shoulder of the Route 80 eastbound express lanes at about 9:15 p.m., State Police Sgt. Philip Curry said. Shindes exited the Jeep and crossed into the local lanes of the highway when he was struck by a Land Rover, where he suffered fatal injuries, Curry said. It is unclear why Shindnes got out of the car. 

Authorities shut down the left and center lanes of the highway for about two hours as they investigated. The driver of the Land Rover stayed at the scene and was cooperating with the investigation, Curry said.
