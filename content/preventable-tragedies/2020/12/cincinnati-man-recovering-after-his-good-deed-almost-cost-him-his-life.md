CINCINNATI —
A good Samaritan who was hit by a car while helping others is fighting hard to regain the ability to walk.

Ramondo Hill, 42, was coming from his adult basketball league when he came upon a bad crash on Central Parkway Nov. 22.While he was trying to help those involved, he said another car came racing out of control and struck him.

Hill has a long road ahead. His sister said her brother could have been killed.

“The first night when I went to the emergency room they said he was pretty bad. He was basically bleeding out because when he got hit by the car. His legs were wrapped up in the wheel barrel of the car. He couldn’t get them out. He had to wait for the EMS. They had to cut him out with the jaws of life,” Rakell Hill said.

Ramondo Hill continues his recovery at Drake Hospital. The other tragedy, one of the people he was trying to help was killed in the accident.

The events of last month remain under police investigation. Members of Hill’s adult basketball league and his family are starting a GoFundMe page to help assist with medical expenses.

Ramondo Hill told WLWT as difficult as everything has been the past 30 days ahead he has no regrets that he stopped at the accident and tried to help and said he would do the same thing again.
