A semi trailer driven by Devontae Lapsley, 26, of Indianapolis, was also south bound in the center lane with cars in each of the lanes beside his truck, according to police. Lapsley was unable to avoid hitting Brashear's car on the passenger side.

Brashear was taken to Indianapolis with serious injuries. Lapsley was uninjured.

The crash had I-69 southbound closed until 4:15 a.m. Saturday morning while investigators worked to clear the scene.
