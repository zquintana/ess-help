MONROE, LA, (April 10, 2020) - A Good Samaritan became a sad victim on Friday, April 10, when Donald Pickel Jr. suffered a serious brain injury after being struck while stopping to help another accident victim in the 3500 block of Desiard Street in Monroe.
The Good Samaritan came upon an accident at about 9 p.m. after a Ford Fusion driven by Dango Dean, 18, struck a woman crossing DeSiard. Dean, Mr. Pickel Jr. and Leonard Smith stopped to help the woman.

That’s when a Nissan Titan driven by Kristopher Brown struck the three people. Mr. Pickel, kneeling over the Monroe woman, was dragged 42 feet by the vehicle.  

Mr. Pickel and the woman, whose name hasn’t been released, were flown to Oschner’s Shreveport with life-threatening injuries.

Mr. Pickel is in critical condition.

The woman is in stable condition.
