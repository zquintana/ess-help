NORTH HAVEN — No one was hurt when a tractor trailer burst into flames after being hit by a tractor trailer on the highway Saturday night.

It happened on Interstate 91 north at Exit 10 shortly after 8 p.m.


Fire officials said a “disabled motor vehicle was struck by a tractor trailer and burst into flames.” The occupants were out of the vehicle by the time the collision happened.

As crews worked to extinguish the flames and get the scene cleared, the left two lanes of I-91 north between Exit 10 and Exit 11 were closed.
