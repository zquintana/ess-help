HAMPTON, Va. â€” A 20-year-old Chesterfield woman died after her disabled sedan was hit from behind on the interstate in Hampton on Saturday.

Virginia State Police said around 7:36 p.m., a call came in of a black Mercedes Benz traveling slowly on westbound Interstate 64 near West Mercury Boulevard.

Minutes later another call came in of a two-vehicle accident near the westbound lanes east of Magruder Boulevard.
The driver of the Mercedes, Keira M. Reese-Johnson, was driving westbound on I-64 when her vehicle became disabled and stopped in the lane, Sgt. Michelle Anaya said.

The Mercedes was struck from behind by a 2005 Suburban.

Johnson was taken to Riverside Regional Hospital with injuries considered life-threatening. She later died at the hospital.

An 11-year-old child inside the Suburban was also taken to the hospital.

Anaya said in an email, "alcohol nor speed were contributing factors in the incident." 

No charges will be placed.
