GAINESVILLE, VA â€” A passenger in a disabled car in a travel lane leading from Interstate 66 to Lee Highway (Route 29) in Gainesville died Saturday from injuries sustained when the car was hit in the rear Friday afternoon by a pickup truck attempting to merge onto Lee Highway, the Prince William County Police Department said Saturday.

At around 4:10 p.m. on Friday, Prince William County police officers responded to the area of Lee Highway and I-66 to investigate the crash. The police investigation found that a 2016 Toyota Corolla was disabled in a travel lane on the ramp from eastbound I-66 to southbound Lee Highway.

A 2005 Chevrolet Silverado was exiting from I-66 to merge onto Lee Highway when it struck the rear of the Toyota Corolla. The passenger in the Toyota Corolla, identified as Phillip Dennis Sorrells, 20, of Germantown, Maryland, was flown to an area hospital with life threatening injuries, where he later died on Saturday. The driver of the Toyota Corolla, a 61-year-old man from Germantown, was transported to an area hospital with serious injuries.

The driver of the Chevrolet Silverado was not injured. Alcohol was not a factor in the crash, the police said.

The driver of the Chevrolet Silverado was identified as a 39-year-old man from Rapidan, Virginia.
