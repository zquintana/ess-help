A woman was struck and killed by tractor-trailer while she was helping people on the side of Interstate 20, according to the Aiken County coroner.
Tamesha Singletary, 44, of Graniteville, was pronounced dead at the Augusta University Medical Center after the accident that happened Friday on I-20 westbound at mile marker 8, Coroner Darryl Ables said.

Singletary was putting gas into the stranded vehicle before being hit by the trailer, the coroner said. Highway Patrol says that the driver was wearing a seat belt and pulled over. There were no other injuries.
