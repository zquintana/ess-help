MONROE, LA, (April 10, 2020) - A woman was seriously injured on Friday, April 10th in Monroe when she was struck by a car and then hit by a second one as two Good Samaritans tried to help her.
The unidentified woman was first struck at about 9:00 p.m. in the 3500 block of DeSiard Street by a 2008 Ford Fusion driven by 18-year-old Dango Dean. The force of the collision sent the woman into the westbound lanes. Dean stopped after the crash and two men, Donald Pickel Jr., and Leonard South, attempted to assist that woman.

At that time, a 2005 Nissan Titan driven by Kristopfer Brown struck the woman and Pickel. South was hit by the Titan’s passenger-side mirror. The woman was flown to Oschner’s LSU Health with life-threatening injuries.

She is now in stable condition. The crash remains under investigation.
