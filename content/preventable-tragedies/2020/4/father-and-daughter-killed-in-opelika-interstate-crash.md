OPELIKA, Ala. (WSFA) - A father and his daughter were killed in a multiple-vehicle accident in Opelika Thursday, according to Lee County Coroner Bill Harris.

Harris said 16-year-old Abbey Darnell and her father, 49-year-old David Darnell, died instantly when the vehicle they were in was hit from behind on Interstate 85 southbound near the 63 mile marker. Harris said it appears the father had pulled off the side of the interstate to check on his daughters vehicle, which had been stranded earlier from a flat tire. A Chevrolet pickup struck the victimsâ€™ vehicle from behind and knocked it into the stranded vehicle.

Harris said the driver of the truck was taken by ambulance to Piedmont Midtown Medical Center in Columbus for treatment. His condition is unknown.
