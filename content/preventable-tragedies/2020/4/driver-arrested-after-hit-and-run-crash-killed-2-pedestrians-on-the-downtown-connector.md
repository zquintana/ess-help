ATLANTA — Authorities said they have arrested a driver who hit and killed two people on the Downtown Connector early Monday morning.

Triple Team Traffic’s Mark Arum said the incident happened before 5 a.m. in the northbound lanes near Edgewood Avenue, north of Interstate 20 in downtown Atlanta.

Police said two people had gotten out of their car after an accident when they were hit by another car. That car then left the scene, police said.
“If you do get out of your vehicle, don’t go walking around on the road,” Avery said. “That’s one of the most dangerous places there is.”
