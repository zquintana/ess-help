BOCA RATON â€” A man is dead and a woman critically injured after a crash Friday night on Interstate 95 in Boca Raton, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

A 27-year-old Jupiter man was driving a pickup south on I-95 shortly before 8 p.m. north of Palmetto Park Road when he wrecked into the back of a sedan stopped on the shoulder on the west side of the road.

The truck hit a 63-year-old Boca man who was outside of the car, killing him.

The crash threw a 52-year-old Coconut Creek woman from the sedan onto the road and left her with critically injuries, state records show.
