A Monroe woman was struck by one car and hit by a second as two men helped her from the first wreck scene Friday. The two men were also injured. 

According to the Monroe Police Department, around 9 p.m. Friday, a police officer was called out to a pedestrian and vehicle wreck in the 3500 block of DeSiard Street. 

Upon arrival he was informed a traffic investigator was already working a pedestrian and vehicle crash in the same location. 

In the first wreck, a 2008 Ford Fusion driven by Dango Dean, age 18, was traveling west bound in the outside lane when it struck a black female crossing DeSiard.

The vehicle hit the left side of her body, and she was projected over the vehicle before falling in the westbound lanes.
