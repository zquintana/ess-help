ROANOKE COUNTY, Va. (WDBJ7)-- UPDATE: Frederick Carter, 60 of Thaxton, first hit the victim after he was unable to see the man who was partially in the road and wearing dark clothes. Objects that were hanging from the driver's rearview mirror obstructed his view as well in this case.

When the driver stopped to help the man, another vehicle hit the victim. His injuries were not critical, according to the statement from Roanoke County.

The driver of the first vehicle has been charged with a hanging obstruction from his rearview mirror. Charges are pending for the victim.

The case remains open.
