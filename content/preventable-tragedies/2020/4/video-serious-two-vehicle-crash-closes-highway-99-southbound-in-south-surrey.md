title: "VIDEO: Serious two-vehicle crash closes Highway 99 southbound in South Surrey"

One woman was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries following a collision Thursday evening in the 3800-block of Highway 99.

Emergency crews responded to the highway, south of King George Boulevard, just before 6 p.m. April 16.
According to a witness at the scene, a large pickup truck appeared to have rear-ended a sedan that was possibly broken down at the side of the road. Both vehicles collided with the centre median cable barrier preventing them from going into oncoming traffic.

A news release from Surrey RCMP Thursday evening said initial indications were that there were potentially life-threatening injuries involved.

However, “once the victim was evaluated, it turned out that the injuries were not life-threatening,” Cpl. Joanie Sidhu told Peace Arch News Friday.

The more seriously injured driver was in the sedan. The truck driver, a man, suffered minor injuries, Sidhu said.
