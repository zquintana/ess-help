MACON COUNTY, Ill. (WCIA) — State law enforcement officials say 32-year-old Eric Ervin from Decatur is dead after he was airlifted to a hospital Wednesday night following a semi crash.

It happened on I-72 near the Argenta exit at mile post 150.

Illinois State Police say a white 2016 Volvo semi-truck was stopped on the side of the eastbound lanes. Andrii Shvabskyi, 27, of Macomb, had been driving that semi until it broke down. Orange caution cones were set out on the interstate.

Ervin came in a yellow 2018 Ford to repair Shvabskyi’s truck, parking to the right of it.

Around 9:14 PM that night, 42-year-old Shawn Morrison from Springfield rear-ended them with his semi-truck. He hit the Volvo, which then hit Ervin’s Ford.

Ervin was airlifted to a hospital where he later died.
