Police said they don't know why the man stopped.The U-Haul driver, who was also in the right lane, tried to swerve into the left lane to avoid hitting the man, but couldn't turn in time. The driver hit the Chevrolet and the man, killing him.The U-Haul then veered out of control before flipping onto its side and stopping across the southbound lanes of the highway. Police closed the road for about four-and-a-half hours while they investigated.
