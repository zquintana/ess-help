ZEELAND, Mich. â€” Westbound I-196 was closed near the Zeeland exit after a semi truck and a box truck collided.

The crash happened at about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. A box truck driven by a 61 year-old Illinois man was stopped in the area between the westbound lanes and the exit for Zeeland. It was hit by a semi truck driven by a 66 year-old Byron Center man when the truck drifted over the line.

The crash flipped the box truck over, and knocked its contents into the roadway, blocking all westbound lanes.

Both men were treated for minor injuries, but were not hospitalized. The freeway was closed for almost 2 hours while crews cleaned up the road.
