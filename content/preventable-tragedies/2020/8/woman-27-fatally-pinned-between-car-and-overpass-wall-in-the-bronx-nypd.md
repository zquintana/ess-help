NEW YORK (1010 WINS) -- A 27-year-old woman died when a tractor trailer slammed into her car as she was standing next to it on the shoulder of a Bronx expressway, pinning her between the car and an overpass wall, the NYPD said. 

Keara Rosa, of Newark, was standing on the shoulder of the Cross Bronx Expressway, near Southern Boulevard, next to her Honda Civic around 12:10 a.m. on Wednesday when a driver in a tractor trailer heading east on the expressway tried to swerve to the left to avoid slow-moving traffic, hitting three other cars, police said. After the tractor trailer hit those cars, it slammed into a concrete wall, swerved right and struck Rosa’s Honda Civic, the NYPD said. Rosa ended up pinned between her Honda Civic and an overpass wall, police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

The drivers of two of the other cars the tractor trailer hit were taken to a nearby hospital in stable condition, the NYPD said. 

The 55-year-old tractor trailer driver stayed at the scene and hadn’t been charged as of Wednesday afternoon. An investigation is ongoing.
