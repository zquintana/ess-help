title: "Car overturns in triple-car collision near Davidson County line, 1 killed"

One person is dead after a three-car collision Thursday night on Interstate 85 near the line between Davidson and Rowan counties, according to the highway patrol. 

Ebony Josephine Evans, 31, of Lexington, was driving south on Interstate 85 near Highway 150 when her car broke down, said Trooper Ned Moultrie with the highway patrol. Evans pulled over to the right shoulder. 

Around 10: 30 p.m, Michael Allen Moore, 42, of Ashland, Virginia, was driving a tractor trailer with a load that extended over the right side of the truck. That load protruding from the tractor trailer hit Evans' car that was sitting in the shoulder, Moultrie said. 

He added that the collision forced Evans' car into the roadway, where her vehicle was hit by a truck driven by a 17-year-old. That caused Evans' car to overturn before coming to rest in the roadway. 

Evans died at the scene, Moultrie said.  

Moore was not injured, and the 17-year-old driver and his passenger, who was also a teenager, were not seriously injured. 

Charges related to the collision are pending, Moultrie said. 

Three lanes on Interstate 85 south were closed until 11:40 p.m. Thursday, according to alerts from the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
