Three people were killed in Marietta on Tuesday morning after the SUV they were in was hit by a tractor-trailer on I-75, police said.

The crash happened about 5:40 a.m. in the northbound lanes of the interstate near the entrance ramp from North Marietta Parkway, the police department said in a statement.

A 2009 Nissan Rogue was stopped in the middle of the road, according to Marietta police spokesman Officer Joshua Madison. It is not clear why the Nissan stopped, he added.

At some point, a tractor-trailer smashed into the stopped SUV, Madison said. Two men and a woman inside the Nissan were pronounced dead at the scene. Their names have not been released.

The driver of the tractor-trailer, identified by police as 52-year-old Linder Rice, was not hurt in the crash, Madison said.An investigation is ongoing.
