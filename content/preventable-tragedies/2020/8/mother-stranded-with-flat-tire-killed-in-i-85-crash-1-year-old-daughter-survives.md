ROWAN COUNTY, N.C. â€” A mother who had pulled off the side of the interstate with a flat tire was killed in a crash minutes later Thursday evening in Rowan County, according to state troopers.

The Highway Patrol told Channel 9 that the crash happened around 8:30 p.m. in the southbound lanes of Interstate 85, near the Davidson County line.Ebony Evans-Kindle, 31, was able to pull off onto the shoulder of I-85 after one of her tires went flat, investigators said. Troopers said her 1-year-old daughter was in the car with her.

Evans-Kindle and the child were in the car waiting for help when a tractor-trailer hauling a commercial mower drove by. Troopers said the mower that was being hauled struck the car, causing the vehicle to hit a guardrail and spin back into traffic, coming to rest facing north in the right lane.According to investigators, the car did not have lights on and was hit head-on by a pickup truck.

Evans-Kindle, who lived in Lexington, was pronounced dead on the scene.

Troopers said the force of the impact caused the car seat that the child was strapped into to be tossed onto the road. Family members told us that the child is in the hospital with broken legs and burns, but is expected to be OK.

Family members said Evans-Kindle was on the way to Salisbury to help a friend.

Barbara Evans said her daughter, who had two other kids, loved her children and always helped others.

The Highway Patrol told Channel 9 they were able to track down the driver of the 18-wheeler but no charges have been filed. Troopers said that after their investigation, they will present their findings to the District Attorney.
