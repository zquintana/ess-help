A Mercer County man was killed Friday night when a box truck slammed into his car that was stalled on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike, authorities said.

Garret Christino, 22, of Hightstown, was killed in the crash in Carneys Point Township after a box truck hit his Nissan Altima, said New Jersey State Trooper Alejandro Goez. The driver of the truck and a passenger in the truck both sustained minor injuries, said Goez.At 10:36 p.m. Friday, New Jersey State Police received a report of a crash on the Turnpike south, said Goez. The Nissan Altima that Christino was driving had a tire blow out and was disabled in the left lane, with part of the car in the left shoulder, said Goez. The car was stalled facing east, perpendicular to the flow of traffic, he said.

The box truck was traveling in the left lane when it collided with Christinoâ€™s Nissan, said Goez. Christino suffered fatal injuries in the crash, said Goez.

The fatal crash shut down the left and right lane for four hours, said Goez. As of Saturday morning, no summons had been issued and the crash is under investigation.
