BOONE COUNTY, Ky. (WKRC) - One person was killed and another driver was injured in a crash on I-71/75 early Saturday morning. The crash started with a disabled vehicle.

Franklin Temaj, 26, was a passenger in a Honda that stopped on the highway at about 1 a.m. A Chrysler could stop in time to avoid hitting the Honda and rear-ended it. That collision pushed the Honda into a concrete carrier and turned it around. A tractor-trailer then struck the Honda.


The Chrysler's driver was taken to the hospital but is expected to survive.
