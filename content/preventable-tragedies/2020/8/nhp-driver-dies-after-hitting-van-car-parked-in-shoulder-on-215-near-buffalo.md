LAS VEGAS (FOX5) -- Nevada Highway Patrol investigated a fatal crash in the southwest valley on Monday night.

According to NHP's website, the crash happened about 8:30 p.m. on August 24 on the 215 Beltway westbound at Buffalo Drive.

The crash involved three vehicles, according to NHP Trooper Travis Smaka. A contractor was driving to a customer's home when he ran out of gas and pulled over. Smaka said the customer drove in a Mercedes to bring gas to the contractor and was also pulled off to the shoulder.

While the driver was outside putting gas into the van, a silver Infinity left the roadway into the shoulder. The Infinity hit the Mercedes, pushing it into the van.

Both vehicles in the shoulder had hazard lights on.

The van's driver was not injured, Smaka said, and the driver of the Mercedes had minor injuries. The driver of the Infinity, later identified as 28-year-old Adrian Joshua Regalado, was taken to University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

The driver was identified by the Clark County Coroner as Adrian Regalado, 28, from Las Vegas.

Smaka said Regalado wasn't wearing a seatbelt. The driver of the Mercedes was, however. 

Smaka said investigators suspect impairment. He said it was a miracle the van's driver was outside and wasn't hit by the vehicle.

He urged drivers to focus on speeds, not driving impaired and wearing a seatbelt.
