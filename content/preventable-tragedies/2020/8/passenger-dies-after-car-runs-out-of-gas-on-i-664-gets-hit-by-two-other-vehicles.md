A woman in a car stopped on Interstate 664 in Newport News died in a crash Saturday, according to Virginia State Police.

Police said the car was hit twice by other vehicles.Around 10:05 p.m., state police were called to a three-vehicle crash on I-664 northbound, south of Terminal Avenue. Terminal Avenue is the first exit on I-664 after the tunnel.

Police said a 2017 BMW 4 Series Coupe carrying two women was in the left lane of the interstate when it ran out of gas, and the driver pulled the car over so it was partially in the left shoulder of the road. The driver turned on the car’s hazard lights, exited the car and waved other vehicles to slow down, police said.After a 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander exited the tunnel, it hit the rear of the BMW, pushing it into the jersey wall and then into the travel lanes of I-664, police said. A 2005 Toyota Avalon then hit the BMW again, police said.

The passenger in the BMW — 74-year-old Ava Jean Newton of Palisade Point in Hampton — died in the crash, police said. Police said she wasn’t wearing a seat belt when the crash happened.The drivers of two other vehicles in the crash have injuries that aren’t considered life-threatening, police said.

Police are investigating the incident, which is pending consultation of the Newport News Commonwealth Attorney’s Office.
