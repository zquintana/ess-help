Jermaine Whitten sadly died on Monday, August 17th in Ashland County after being struck by a commercial vehicle while trying to assist the driver of a disabled SUV. Whitten, 19, was a passenger in the SUV, which was eastbound on U.S. 30 in when it went off the right side of the roadway and struck a guardrail. The passengers were able to exit the Chevrolet HHR, which then was disabled in the roadway. Whitten returned to the vehicle to assist the driver and attempt to get it out of the roadway. While Whitten was standing next to the Chevy, he and the SUV were struck by a commercial vehicle driven by 54-year-old Michael Makar, which was traveling eastbound.

Sadly, Whitten was pronounced dead at the scene.
