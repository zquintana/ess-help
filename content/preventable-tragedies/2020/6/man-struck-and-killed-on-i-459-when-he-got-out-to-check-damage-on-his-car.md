BESSEMER, Ala. (WBRC) - Bessemer police are investigating after a man was killed when he got out of his car to check damage after an accident on I-459.

The Jefferson County Coroner said 66-year-old Harold Lee Henson was struck Friday morning around 5:00 a.m. in I-459 North in Bessemer.

The coroner said the person who hit Henson drove off and Henson pulled his car into the emergency lane on the right shoulder of the road.
