TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - Authorities were investigating a vehicle / pedestrian accident Monday evening.

First responders were called just before 8 p.m. to SE 6th near Rice Rd.

Topeka Police say a van was stalled in the median, with several people trying to change a tire. TPD says a semi tractor was following a vehicle in the eastbound traffic lane. The vehicle stopped to offer assistance, causing the semi tractor to swerve and hit the van, which then hit two of the people.

Authorities say the two people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, and are expected to be okay.
