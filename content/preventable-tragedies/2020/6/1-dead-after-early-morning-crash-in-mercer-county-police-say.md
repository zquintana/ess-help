One person died in a highway accident early Saturday in Hamilton, the New Jersey State Police said.

A Hyundai Santa Fe driving south on I-295 hit the back of a “disabled” tractor-trailer, according to Sgt. Lawrence Peele.

The driver died around 4:45 a.m. near mile marker 58, Peele wrote in an email. The highway’s right two lanes were then closed for about 4 and a half hours.More details about the crash, including the driver’s name, were not immediately available and the accident remains under investigation.

A spokesman for Hamilton police directed questions back to the State Police, which patrols the highway.
