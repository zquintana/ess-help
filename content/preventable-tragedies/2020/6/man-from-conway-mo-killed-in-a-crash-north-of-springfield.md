NEAR SPRINGFIELD, Mo-- The highway patrol says Kelly Hargis, 19, of Conway was killed in a crash north of Springfield.

Troopers say Hargis swerved to avoid a car that was stopped on West Farm Road 102 Wednesday afternoon. The car hit a tree and a utility pole after it ran off the road.

A 16-year-old passenger wasn't hurt.
