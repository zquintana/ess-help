McLean County Coroner Dr. Kathy Yoder identified the victim as 57-year-old Richard E. Gaunt, Jr., of Morton.

An investigation from the Illinois State Police (ISP) determined that the driver was traveling eastbound on I-74. Gaunt was outside his vehicle on the right shoulder at milepost 125. He was securing the load on top of his vehicle. For unknown reasons, the driver exited right off the roadway and struck the vehicle and Gaunt.
