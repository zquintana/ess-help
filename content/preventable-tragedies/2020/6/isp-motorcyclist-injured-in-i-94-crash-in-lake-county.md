title: "ISP: Motorcyclist injured in I-94 crash in Lake County"
---
A motorcyclist was seriously injured early this morning after crashing into a disabled vehicle in an I-80/94 through-lane in Lake County, the Indiana State Police said.

According to police, at 12 a.m. a three-vehicle accident in the eastbound lanes of I-80/94 at the 4 mile marker left one of the vehicles disabled in the far left lane. The other two vehicles succeeded in stopping on the shoulder out of traffic.

A motorcyclist traveling in the left lane, though, identified as Steven C. Melton, 26, of Hebron, was unable to see the disabled vehicle, “due to the curvature of the roadway and the car’s lights being damaged from the earlier crash,” police said. At the last moment, Melton “intentionally put his motorcycle down in an attempt to avoid the car. However, the motorcycle and rider slid towards the car. As the motorcycle slid, it flipped over, throwing the rider between his motorcycle and the car. Both the rider and motorcycle then struck the side of the car.”

“Due to the severity of (Melton’s) injuries, Trooper W. Stancy applied a tourniquet to the rider’s lower extremity prior to paramedics’ arriving at the scene,” police said. Melton was subsequently transported by ambulance to Advocate Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn, Ill.
