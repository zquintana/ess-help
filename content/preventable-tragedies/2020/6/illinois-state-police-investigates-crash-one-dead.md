COOK COUNTY, Ill. â€” The Ilinois State Police (ISP) is investigating two crashes that happened at the same location within minutes of each other.

The crashes happened on I-94 southbound in Cook County around 12:30 A.M. on Sunday.

According to ISP, Francisco Carreno, Jr.,34, of Chicago was driving a 2001 Infiniti QX4 when he lost control of the car, swerved left, hit the concrete median wall, and overturned into the roadway.

Carreno, Melisa Camacho, 34, and three children were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.


After the Infiniti crashed, three good samaritans, Curtis Deyante Hale Melton of Maywood, 31, Ezekiel J. Williams of Chicago, 25, and Corey Seifer of Chicago, 25, stopped to help Carreno and the other passengers from the rolled-over car.

ISP said Sabrina R. Johnson, 45, of Chicago was driving a 2017 Nissan Sentra when she failed to slow down and struck those three pedestrians.

Melton was pronounced dead at the scene.

Williams and Seifer were taken to the hospital with serious injuries.

The investigation is still ongoing.
