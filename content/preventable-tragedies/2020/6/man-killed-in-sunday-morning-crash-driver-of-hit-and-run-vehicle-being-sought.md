A Statesville man died early Sunday morning in a hit-and-run crash on Chestnut Grove Road at Beechwood Farm Road.

Robert Bruce Selvey, 55, of Statesville, died at the scene, said Sgt. Chad Crouse of the North Carolina Highway Patrol.

He said Selveyâ€™s 2004 Buick Lesabre apparently broke down and was sitting sideways in the road. Selvey, Crouse said, was either sitting in his car or standing outside of it when a 2011 Ford F-150 struck the Buick and also hit Selvey.
