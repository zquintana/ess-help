SENECA, IL â€” The Grundy County Coroner's Office announced that a 20-year-old Chicago man was killed early Tuesday after being struck by a semi along Interstate 80 near mile marker 105. The coroner's office said that Jake Enblom was driving eastbound along I-80 when he hit a guardrail. Afterward, Enblom got out of his vehicle and began walking in the eastbound lane of traffic and a semi-tractor trailer hit him around 1:30 a.m., the coroner's office said.

An ambulance from Seneca rushed Emblom to the Morris Hospital and he was pronounced dead on arrival, the coroner's office said. The fatality is being investigated by the Illinois State Police and the Grundy County Coroner's Office, Tuesday's news release noted.
