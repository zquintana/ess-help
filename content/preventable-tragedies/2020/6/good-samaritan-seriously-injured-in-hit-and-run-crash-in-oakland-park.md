OAKLAND PARK, Fla. – Broward Sheriff’s Office traffic homicide detectives are searching for the driver who seriously injured a Good Samaritan last week who was helping out another whose car had become disabled in Oakland Park.


The hit-and-run crash was reported around 12:15 a.m. Wednesday in the eastbound lanes of East Cypress Creek Road at North Dixie Highway.

Deputies said the victim, James Patterson, was helping the driver whose car broke down when he was struck by a vehicle similar to a 2013-2016 Lexus GS 350.

Detectives believe the driver was trying to turn right, but turned too wide, striking Patterson who was standing under the hood of the disabled car.

The driver fled the scene, authorities said.
