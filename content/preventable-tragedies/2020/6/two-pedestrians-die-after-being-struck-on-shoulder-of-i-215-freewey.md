Two pedestrians who were standing on the right shoulder of the Interstate 215 Freeway died after being struck by a vehicle on June 30, according to the California Highway Patrol.

At about 11:45 p.m., a 22-year-old Ontario man driving a 2013 White Ford E350 box truck was traveling on I-215 southbound,

south of Palm Avenue in San Bernardino. At the same time, the pedestrians were standing outside two parked vehicles on I-215.

For reasons still under investigation, the driver of the Ford allowed it to travel to the right shoulder. The front of the Ford collided into the rear of a disabled 1997 Beige Toyota Camry and subsequently hit the two pedestrians.
