A father and his 4-year-old son were killed Saturday night as they tried to cross North Freeway in Spring, authorities said.

The father was driving southbound on Interstate 45 near FM 1960 when their black Jeep SUV spun out of control and careened into the median around 9:30 p.m., said Lt. Simon Chang of the Harris County Sheriff's Office.

Witnesses told investigators that the pair emerged from their vehicle and attempted to cross the lanes when they were struck by a silver Toyota sedan driving on the freeway. The sedan's driver did not stop in time.
Both died at the scene. The driver and two passengers in the car stopped and cooperated with investigators, Chang said.Chang said both of the wheels on the driver's side of the Jeep appeared to have been broken on the axle, likely making the vehicle incapable of being moved to a shoulder.
