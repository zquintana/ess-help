---
A Summerfield man was at the wheel of a pickup that struck and killed a man who was inspecting a flat tire Thursday night by the side of the road in Marion County.

Th 32-year-old had been traveling northbound at 8:50 p.m. on County Road 475 when his pickup hit the 31-year-old Puerto Rican man who had stopped to examine the flat tire of the vehicle in which he had been traveling, according to an accident report from the Florida Highway Patrol. He was pronounced dead at the scene at 9:12 p.m. by Marion County Fire Rescue.

The pickup also struck two other people who had been at the side of the road looking at the flat tire â€“ a 29-year-old Puerto Rican man who was seriously injured and a nine-year-old boy from Summerfield who suffered minor injuries. A 34-year-old Summerfield man who had been with them escaped without injury.

The names of those involved in the accident are being withheld in accordance with a new policy enacted earlier this year by FHP.
