LAKE CITY â€” A Lake City teen was in serious condition after being struck by a vehicle late Tuesday.

Jack Thomas Bremer, 18, of Lake City, was driving south on U.S. 61 north of Lake City at 11:16 p.m. Tuesday when his vehicle left the roadway and came to rest in the southbound shoulder of the road. Bremer got out of his car and was then struck by a vehicle driven by Lia Marie Safe, 41, of Mazeppa, who was also driving south on Highway 61, according to a Minnesota State Patrol report.

Safe was not injured during the collision. However, Bremer was transported to Mayo Clinic Hospital-Saint Marys with life-threatening injuries. Bremer was listed in fair condition Wednesday, according to a Mayo Clinic spokeswoman.

The Goodhue County Sheriff's Office, Lake City Police Department and both Lake City Ambulance and Fire departments responded to the scene.
