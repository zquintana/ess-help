DOWNEY, CA, (June 18, 2020) - Good Samaritan Nancy Segoviano was tragically struck and killed by car on Thursday, June 18th in Downey while trying to assist a disabled vehicle with children in it.
Segoviano, 36, was traveling in a Honda Pilot driven by 47-year-old Bruno Rodriguez on the southbound Santa Ana (5) Freeway when they noticed a disabled Mitsubishi Lancer near the Lakewood Boulevard exit. Rodriguez stopped the Pilot and he and Segoviano exited the vehicle to check on the occupants of the Lancer. Segoviano began walking back to the Honda when a Ford Mustang driven by 18-year-old Travis Le swerved to avoid the Mitsubishi.

The Mustang hit Rodriguez's right hand and continued forward, striking Segoviano, before crashing into the Honda. The occupants of the Honda, included three children, ages 10, 12 and 14. Segoviano, Rodriguez and the three children, who have not been identified by authorities, were taken to a local hospital.
