BATTLE CREEK, MI (WKZO AM/FM) -- A Battle Creek man is in critical condition after he was thrown off of his motorcycle and then hit by another vehicle that then fled the scene.

It happened around 3:30 p.m. Thursday at the intersection of Helmer Road and Goguac Street in Springfield, near the Battle Creek Executive Airport at Kellogg Field.

Calhoun County Sheriff deputies say the 31-year-old motorcyclist rear-ended a vehicle that was stopped on the roadway to turn left onto Goguac. He was thrown off of the motorcycle into the northbound lane and then the vehicle behind the motorcycle drove into the oncoming lane, struck the biker in the roadway, and took off.

Witnesses say the vehicle was a silver color passenger vehicle and that the driver took off traveling southbound on Helmer, but no other information has been provided at this time.
