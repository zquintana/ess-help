title: "Driver in fatal H-1 freeway crash in Kapolei identified"
---
A 46-year-old man was killed after being struck by multiple vehicles in the Kapolei area early Tuesday, and an off-duty deputy sheriff who pulled over to render aid was seriously injured when he was struck by a vehicle that fled the scene, police said.

The Honolulu Medical Examinerâ€™s Office identified the 46-year-old man as Ioane Tafaovale, of Waianae.

Police said a white delivery truck operated by the man later identified as Tafaovale was traveling eastbound on the H-1 freeway when the truck and a silver 2001 Chevy pickup truck operated by a 37-year-old man collided shortly before 5 a.m.
Tafaovale lost control and struck a center median. Upon impact, he was thrown onto the westbound lanes of the freeway where multiple vehicles struck him.

Police said the delivery truck continued on and slammed into a light pole.

The off-duty deputy sheriff, who the Hawaii Department of Public Safety identified as Albert Rosario, 37, pulled over and exited his car to help Tafaovale when a vehicle described as a silver sedan struck Rosario and fled the scene.

Emergency Medical Services treated the deputy and took him to a hospital in serious condition.

Tafaovale was pronounced dead at the scene.
