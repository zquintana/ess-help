FOREST PARK, OH, (June 16, 2020) - Timmy Burke was tragically struck and killed by a semi-truck on Tuesday, June 16th in Forest Park while standing outside his car following a previous crash.
Burkeâ€™s 2001 Mercury Grand Marquis became disabled in the middle lane of Interstate 275 West at about 4:30 a.m. after an accident. At that time, two 18-wheelers were driving in the same westbound middle lane of I-275. The first truck, a 2020 Volvo, driven by a 50-year-old woman, swerved to avoid Burke's vehicle. However, she still struck the Grand Marquis.

The second big rig, a 2019 Freightliner driven by a 50-year-old man, failed to maintain an assured clear distance ahead and hit the back of Volvo and then Burke's Grand Marquis. The driver then struck Burke as he was standing outside of his vehicle in the roadway. Sadly, Burke, 42, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Ohio State Patrol is investigating the crash.
