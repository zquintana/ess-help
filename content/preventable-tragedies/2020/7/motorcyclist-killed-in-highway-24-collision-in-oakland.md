OAKLAND — A 51-year-old motorcyclist was killed late Wednesday night in a collision with a car on Highway 24, the California Highway Patrol said.

The Alameda County Coroner’s Office identified the man Thursday as Christopher Jones of Davis.

The collision happened about 11:17 p.m. Wednesday in the eastbound lanes of Highway 24 just west of Highway 13 near the Caldecott Tunnel.

The CHP said Jones was riding a Yamaha motorcycle. He had pulled onto the right-hand shoulder for unknown reasons and was re-entering traffic when he was hit by a Honda Accord, ejecting him from the motorcycle into a traffic lane.
