ALPINE, N.J. (AP) â€” A Brooklyn man who apparently got out of his minivan because he thought he had hit an animal was struck and killed by a car on a parkway linking New York and New Jersey, police said.

The 41-year-old man was hit Thursday on the northbound Palisades Interstate Parkway in Alpine, New Jersey, just before the New York state line.
