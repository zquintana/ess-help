GRAND RAPIDS, MI – A man who got out of his car after a crash on U.S. 131 was critically injured Tuesday, July 28, when another vehicle crashed into his car, which then hit him, state police said.

A good Samaritan pulled the injured man out of a northbound lane.

The injured man, a 44-year-old Grand Rapids resident, was listed in critical condition at Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital, police said.

The incident began just after 4:30 a.m. when the now-injured man, going north on U.S. 131 near Wealthy Street, lost control of his car and it struck the median wall. The driver got out and stood near his car.

Police think that the car was partially in the far-left lane when it was struck by a passing vehicle, driven by a 48-year-old Wyoming man. The collision pushed the Grand Rapids man’s car into him and threw him into northbound U.S. 131 with serious injuries.

The other driver was not seriously injured.

Moments later, another driver swerved to avoid hitting the man in the road and struck another northbound vehicle. Neither driver was hurt. A good Samaritan pulled the injured Grand Rapids man to the side of the road before emergency crews reached the scene.

The freeway was closed until just after 8 a.m.

State police continue to investigate what led to the initial crash.
