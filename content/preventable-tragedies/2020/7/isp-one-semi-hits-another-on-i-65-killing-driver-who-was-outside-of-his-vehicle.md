JACKSON COUNTY, Ind. â€”
A semitruck driver is dead after a crash that happened while he was on the side of the road.

According to Indiana State Police, Daniel Cosma, 41, of North Royalton, Ohio, was driving his semi south on I-65 Thursday morning when he had a mechanical issue in a construction zone.
Police said he stopped near Seymour, and sat in the right lane, since there was no shoulder.

Cosma apparently exited his vehicle to work on it. While outside, his truck was hit by another semi. ISP said that semi forced the Cosma's into him, causing his death.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Part of I-65 was closed for several hours. The crash was reported around 9:30 a.m. and reopened around 1 p.m.

It does not appear at this time that the driver of the second semi is facing any charges.

Alcohol and drugs are not suspected to be factors in the crash although toxicology results are pending at this time. The investigation is ongoing.
