SEQUOYAH COUNTY, Okla. (KFOR) â€“ Authorities with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol are searching for a semi-truck that was involved in a deadly hit-and-run crash.

Around 7 p.m. on Saturday, July 18, troopers were called to a deadly hit-and-run crash on eastbound I-40, north of Moffett, in Sequoyah County.

Witnesses told troopers that a white semi-truck pulling a white box trailer hit a truck and a pedestrian.

Officials say Robert Rabe was driving a 1977 Chevy truck eastbound on I-40 when he got a flat tire and had to pull onto the shoulder.

As he was changing the flat tire, he and his truck were hit by the semi-truck.

Troopers say the semi-truck may have damage to the right front or right side of the trailer, adding that it was heading into Arkansas.
