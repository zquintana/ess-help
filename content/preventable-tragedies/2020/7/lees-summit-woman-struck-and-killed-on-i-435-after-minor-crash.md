KANSAS CITY, Mo. — A Lee’s Summit woman was killed when she got out of her car following a minor traffic accident along Interstate 435 and was hit by another vehicle, police in Kansas City said.

The incident happened late Wednesday night in the northbound lanes of I-435 when 40-year-old Heather Fitzgerald’s car and a truck collided, police said.

Investigators believe the car was left disabled in the far left lane of traffic, and Fitzgerald got out of the car and stood on the shoulder of the interstate. Police said a northbound sport utility vehicle then came upon the disabled car and tried to avoid it by veering around it onto the shoulder, hitting the car and Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald died at the scene, police said.

The driver of the SUV stopped at the crash and was released pending further investigation, police said.
