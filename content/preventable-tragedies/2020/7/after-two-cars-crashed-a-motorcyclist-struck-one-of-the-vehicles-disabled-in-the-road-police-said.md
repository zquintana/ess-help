ATLANTIC CITY, NJ â€” A Pleasantville man died after his motorcycle hit a car disabled on the roadway. Brian Lewis, 49, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Two cars crashed at milepost 55.2 westbound at 2:02 a.m. Sunday. Shortly after, Lewis's motorcycle hit one of the vehicles.

Before Lewis arrived, another Pleasantville resident parked a Volkswagen Jetta on the shoulder, activating the hazard lights. An Egg Harbor Township resident driving a Kia Sportage left the road for an unknown reason and struck the Volkswagen, police said.

The Kia came to rest in the right lane. Lewis crashed into the Kia shortly after, police said.
