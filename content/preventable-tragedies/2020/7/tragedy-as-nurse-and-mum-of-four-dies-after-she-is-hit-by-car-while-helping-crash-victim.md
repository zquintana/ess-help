A "loving and selfless" mum-of-four has died after she was hit by a car when she stopped to help a driver who had been in an accident.Nurse Ana Kincart, 36, was on her way to work when she spotted the crash in Boone County, Kentucky, and pulled over to assist the motorist.

A Facebook post written by Ana's grief stricken family members says their hearts have been '"ripped out".

The post reads: "Our beautiful Daughter Ana was killed yesterday in a car crash on the Carroll Cropper Bridge."While on her way to work she witnessed a car crash in front of her. Being a nurse she exited her car to check on the young man in the accident.
