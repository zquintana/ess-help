ORLANDO, Fla. – A 35-year-old Orlando woman was killed and two others were injured late Wednesday in a three-vehicle crash that sent a car flying off Interstate 4 in Orange County, the Florida Highway Patrol said.

The fatal wreck occurred around 11 p.m. on I-4 west near Sand Lake Road.The FHP said a 25-year-old Orlando man was driving a car west when he struck the back of the car in front of him, which was driven by the 35-year-old woman, who had slowed down to assist the driver of a disabled sport utility vehicle that was on the shoulder of I-4.

The 35-year-old woman, who was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected from her car, troopers said. She was taken to a hospital and later died, according to the FHP.

The car that struck her left the road, went through a fence and came to a stop on Turkey Lake Road, the FHP said. The driver suffered minor injuries, troopers said.

The driver of the SUV, a 32-year-old Davenport woman, also suffered minor injuries, according to the FHP.

“Multiple patients transported to area hospitals with serious injuries. Multiple callers advised a vehicle flew off I-4, landing on Turkey Lake Road,” Orange County Fire Rescue tweeted after the wreck.

The crash blocked I-4 west for hours, but the interstate was later reopened.
