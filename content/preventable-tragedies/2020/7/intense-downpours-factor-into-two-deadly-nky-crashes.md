Three people were killed in two separate accidents Monday during intense storms in Boone County.

Two people were killed in a multi-car pileup on Interstate 275 on Monday morning near the Indiana-Kentucky border.It happened around 8:30 a.m. in the westbound lanes of the interstate at the 13.4-mile marker, near the Carroll Cropper Bridge.

According to officials with the Boone County Sheriff’s Office, it started as a single-vehicle accident involving a Chevrolet Camaro.

“Shortly after that accident, there were three subsequent accidents and during the course of those is what took the lives of two people," said Boone County Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Philip Ridgell.

Investigators said the crash involved a Jeep Wrangler, a Chevrolet Trailblazer and a Ford F-150.

The driver of the Camaro and the Jeep were pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities identified the victims as Anna Kincart, 36, of Petersburg, Kentucky, and Brandon Hicks, of Norwood, Ohio.

The driver of the Trailblazer was taken to the hospital for treatment, and is expected to survive, deputies said.

The crash prompted the closure of westbound lanes of the interstate for several hours Monday morning. Those lanes have since been reopened.

Investigators said wet roads were a factor in the crash and in another fatal crash about an hour later on northbound 71/75 at the Richwood exit.

Allyson Davis, 21, of Floyd County, Kentucky, was killed when she lost control and her vehicle became pinned under a semi.

"It appears the operator of that vehicle was traveling in the left lane and drove over top of some water that had pooled on the interstate," Ridgell said.
