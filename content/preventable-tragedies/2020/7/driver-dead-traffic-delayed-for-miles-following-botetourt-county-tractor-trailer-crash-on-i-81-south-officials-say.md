Virginia State Police announced the pickup truck driver who was seriously injured in Wednesday morning’s tractor-trailer crash in Botetourt County later died in the hospital.

According to police, the crash — which involved two tractor-trailers and a pickup truck — took place at 5:18 a.m. Wednesday along I-81 South in Botetourt County.

Authorities say the pickup truck struck a tractor-trailer that was illegally parked on the right side of the road, but after the pickup truck came to rest in the roadway, another tractor-trailer heading south on I-81 hit the pickup truck.

The pickup truck driver was reportedly transported to Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where police say he later died. State troopers are currently working to notify the driver’s next of kin.

In the meantime, I-81 South is blocked at mile marker 58 until crews remove the vehicles, according to Virginia State Police.

VDOT says all traffic will be detoured off at Exit 162, onto U.S. Route 11 South, onto Route 460 West and Brughs Mill Road, and back onto I-81 South at mile marker 156. However, officials say there is three miles of congestion from the detour site, and the on-ramp for Exit 162 is closed at this time.

This crash is still under investigation by Virginia State Police.
