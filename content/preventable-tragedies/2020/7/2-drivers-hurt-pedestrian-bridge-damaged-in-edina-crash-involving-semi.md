The drivers of a semi truck and a second vehicle were taken to Southdale Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries following a crash Tuesday morning in Edina.

According to the Minnesota State Patrol, the two-vehicle crash happened just before 6 a.m.

Officials said the semi was traveling south on Highway 100 near Benton Avenue when it hit a Buick Lacrosse on the road's right shoulder. The semi swerved, and went up the highway's embankment.

The semi then crashed into a pedestrian bridge in the area, damaging it.

The Minnesota Department of Transportation reported Normandale Road was blocked by the semi following the crash.

The crash remains under investigation, according to the state patrol.
