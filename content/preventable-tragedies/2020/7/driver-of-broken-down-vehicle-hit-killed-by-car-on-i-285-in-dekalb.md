A deadly multivehicle crash on I-285 in DeKalb County blocked all eastbound lanes of the Perimeter for hours Friday afternoon.

The wreck occurred shortly before 12:30 p.m. near the Moreland Avenue exit on the outer loop, according to the Georgia State Patrol. The incident began after a Chevrolet Malibu broke down in the second left lane and its driver got out.

The man, identified Saturday as 32-year-old Jimmy Tajada, was standing by the rear of the car when he was hit by a Chevrolet Impala that also struck the Malibu, the GSP said. Tajada was pronounced dead at the scene.

A rear passenger in the Malibu suffered non-life-threatening injuries, and so did the driver of the Impala, according to the GSP. No other information was provided.

The crash wasnâ€™t cleared until a little after 3 p.m. According to the WSB 24-hour Traffic Center, delays were still more than an hour after eastbound travel resumed.
