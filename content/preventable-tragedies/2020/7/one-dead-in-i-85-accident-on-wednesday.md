One person died in a crash Wednesday on Interstate 85 just outside of Lexington.

The N.C. Highway Patrol responded at 6:22 p.m. to a fatal collision on Interstate 85 northbound, said Trooper Ned Moultrie.

Zacorran Gaither, 29, of Catawba, had been driving a 2004 Saturn and attempted to pass other vehicles on the shoulder, Moultrie said. Gaither struck another car that was sitting on the shoulder. He died as a result of the accident.

The two people in the other car were taken to Lexington Memorial Hospital. Their condition is unknown.
