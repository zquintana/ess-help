Maryland State Police are requesting the publicâ€™s help in identifying and locating a vehicle and driver involved in a hit and run crash on I-95 in Howard County Sunday night that critically injured three people.

Police said a series of three crashes occurred between approximately 9:15 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on southbound I-95 near Rt. 100. The first crash occurred when a 2020 Nissan Armada struck a deer and traveled onto the left shoulder and struck the guardrail. A portion of the vehicle remained in the fast lane of I-95. The driver activated the hazards on the car.The second crash occurred when a 2018 Chrysler Pacifica driving south struck the Nissan on the passenger side. The driver of the Chrysler pulled to the left shoulder in front of the Nissan and stopped.

The hit-and-run crash occurred when an unidentified vehicle traveling southbound struck the two occupants of the Nissan who were believed to be standing behind their car. That same vehicle then struck the driver of the Chrysler, who was standing at the front of the Nissan. The driver did not stop and fled the scene.

The victims are all adults, but have yet to be positively identified or have families notified. Due to the extent of their injuries, they were taken to the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center for treatment.

The Maryland State Police Crash Team is investigating. Vehicle parts possibly from the suspect vehicle have been recovered at the scene and will be used to try to identify a vehicle make/model.
