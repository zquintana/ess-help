Rojas, 19, struck outside of disabled Toyota on the San Diego (405) Freeway
LOS ANGELES, CA, (September 24, 2020) - Ceilo Romero Rojas was tragically struck and killed by a vehicle on the southbound Ceilo Romero Rojas in southwest Los Angeles on Thursday, September 24th.
According to the California Highway Patrol (CHP), Rojas was riding in a 2005 Toyota at about 3:35 a.m. that became disabled in the Nos. 1 and 2 lanes following a crash. She and the driver got out of the car and made their way to the right shoulder of the freeway, and then went back to the car to recover personal items. At that time, Rojas, 19, was struck by a 2004 Toyota driven by a 24-year-old Santa Ana woman.

Sadly, Rojas was pronounced dead at the scene. The CHP is investigating the accident.During its probe, the CHP will try to determine what caused the Santa Ana woman to strike and kill Ms. Rojas.

Crashes such as this are often the result of distracted driving, speeding, negligent driving, and drivers failing to yield to a pedestrian. Pending the CHP’s investigation, the driver of the 2004 Toyota could be ticketed or criminally charged.

Anyone with information on the crash was urged to call the CHP South Los Angeles Area office at 424-551-4000. Candice Bond, an experienced accident attorney, noted that in cases such as this it's imperative to have an independent probe conducted by a seasoned lawyer to help protect the family of a victim’s rights.

“Time is of the essence in cases such as this and the family of victim must ensure that evidence is reviewed in an efficient manner,” said Bond, Managing Partner at Bond Legal. “An attorney will carefully review what may have contributed to the crash and has the resources to hire expert witnesses, conduct drivers’ background checks, locate witnesses to the crash and review applicable insurance coverage. Serving as an advocate, an attorney can help compassionately guide a family during this difficult time, while protecting their legal rights and interests.”
