title: "2 injured in string of wrecks on I-285 in Dunwoody"

Two people were injured in a series of crashes that shutdown several eastbound lanes of I-285 for nearly two hours during the Friday morning commute, authorities said.

The wrecks occurred shortly before 6:50 a.m. in the left lanes of the inner loop near Ashford Dunwoody Road, the WSB 24-hour Traffic Center reported.

According to Dunwoody police, the first crash occurred when a black sedan lost control and hit the wall. Another car stopped to check on the driver, who was stopped in the far left lane, when a white sedan swerved to avoid the crash and also hit the median wall.

The driver of the white car got out of their vehicle and was struck by a pickup truck hauling a trailer full of lawn equipment, Dunwoody police spokesman Sgt. Robert Parsons said. The truck then hit struck a second car. A fourth crash occurred when a silver sedan slowed down to get around the wrecks and was rear-ended, police said.Two people were taken to hospitals with injuries but both are expected to survive, authorities said.

The wrecks caused major delays on the Perimeter as drivers heading to work were forced to squeeze by in just two right lanes.WSB traffic reporter Mark Arum urged drivers at one point to avoid the Perimeter.

All lanes reopened about 8:30 a.m., but the crashes caused major delays in the area, according to the Traffic Center.
