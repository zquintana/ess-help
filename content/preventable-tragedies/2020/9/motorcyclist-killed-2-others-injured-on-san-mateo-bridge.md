title: "Motorcyclist killed, 2 others injured on San Mateo Bridge"

A motorcyclist was thrown into the Bay and killed yesterday after he hit a broken down car on the San Mateo Bridge, the CHP reports.

The rider and passenger of a second motorcycle suffered major injuries and were rushed to Stanford Hospital.
It happened at a few minutes before 10 a.m. when a group of motorcyclists were headed west on the bridge.

They came upon a disabled BMW that had stopped in the No. 3 lane (that’s the lane farthest from the center divide). Most of the group was able to move to the No. 2 lane and avoid hitting the BMW. However, for unknown reasons, the last two motorcycles didn’t switch lanes and hit the BMW.

The BMW’s driver and passenger had exited their vehicle and were walking west when the accidents occurred.
The rider of one motorcycle was ejected from his 2015 Harley Davidson and he flew over the bridge railing and into the water. His body was later recovered by the U.S. Coast Guard. The CHP said he was a 34-year-old man from Sacramento, but the coroner hasn’t yet released his name.

The rider of the second bike, a 2016 Harley Davidson, is Andrew T. Richardson, 24, of Modesto, and his passenger is Catera L. Celis, 22, of Modesto, according to the CHP.

The CHP said it is unknown at this time if drugs or alcohol were a factor in the accidents.
