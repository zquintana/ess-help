CARY, N.C. — After a woman was killed Thursday morning on U.S. Highway 1 in Cary, law enforcement officers said her situation – stuck in a stalled vehicle in the middle of the highway – is always dangerous.

If there are cars all around traveling at highway speed, the best option may be to stay in your car, with your seatbelt on, until help arrives.

If it's safe in all directions, officers say you should run for the shoulder.

Police have not said whether 27-year-old Melissa Dewey, of Ohio, was inside or out of her car when it was struck from behind by a Jeep Cherokee.

The crash closed U.S. Highway 1 between Cary Parkway and the U.S. Highway 64/Tryon Road Interchange for about three hours.
