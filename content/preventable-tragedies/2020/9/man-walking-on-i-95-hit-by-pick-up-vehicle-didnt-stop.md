The vehicle, which FHP believe is a Chevrolet Pickup Silverado 1500, struck the pedestrian causing the man to propel into the air and land in the right travel lane of the Express Lane. The vehicle year of the truck is between a 1999-2006, the pic-up is a light color, and possibly has custom rims. The truck will have damage to the front end.FHP located a 2001 silver Toyota Corolla not too far from where the man was hit. The disabled car was parked in the emergency lane and was registered to the victim. Investigators are looking into if the man was walking from the car that may have broken down when he was hit.
