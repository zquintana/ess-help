Linn County area responders were called to a two vehicle crash at the intersection of Highways 13 and 30 Thursday evening.

Upon arriving, they found that a truck traveling westbound had struck a car that was disabled on the north side of the highway, pushing it into the ditch where it then caught fire. The occupant of the car was standing near the vehicle when it was struck but was uninjured.

The driver of the truck, 21 year old Logan Seeley of Anamosa, was also uninjured. Seeley received a traffic citation for the crash.
