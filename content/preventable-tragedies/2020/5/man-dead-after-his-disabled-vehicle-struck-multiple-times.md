title: "Man dead after his disabled vehicle struck multiple times"
---
A man has died after police say his disabled vehicle was struck multiple times Saturday night.

San Antonio Police were called out to an accident near the intersection of I-10 at UTSA Boulevard at around 10:30 p.m. Saturday night. When they arrived at the scene, there was a man trapped in a green Ford Explorer with no pulse and two other vehicles with significant damage.

Police believe that the driver of the Ford Explorer struck the wall on the far right side for some unknown reason and was sent flying across the highway to the left side. Shortly after his collision, a white pickup truck came along and hit the Explorer at a high rate of speed. Then another car, a four-door sedan, passed the accident and lost control of their vehicle, striking the wall a little further down form the original crash.
Police said the driver of the Explorer was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the pickup truck was taken to to a nearby hospital with unknown injuries.
