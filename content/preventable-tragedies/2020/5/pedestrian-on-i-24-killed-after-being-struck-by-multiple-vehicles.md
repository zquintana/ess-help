LA VERGNE, Tenn. (WTVF) â€” A woman is dead after having been struck by a number of vehicles on I-24 West at the Davidson/Rutherford County line, Metro police say.

The preliminary investigation shows that the 22-year-old Memphis woman was driving her Nissan Versa east on I-24 prior to the incident, missing the driver's side tire and traveling on the rim for some time. Her car then hit the guardrail on the right shoulder of I-24 East.
Another driver reported seeing a person lying on the interstate's left shoulder, who stood up, jumped over the median wall and ran across westbound lanes. That driver stopped and yelled at the person to see if they were okay, when the person waved and ran off.

Around 4:30 a.m., a westbound 2017 Nissan Titan pickup struck the woman in the far left lane. She was then struck by several other vehicles that did not remain at the scene.

At the time of the incident, the woman was only wearing one shoe. The matching shoe was found in her Versa. While her driver's license was found in the vehicle, police are still working with family to make a positive identification.

Investigators found no evidence of drug or alcohol use on the part of the Nissan Titan driver. Toxicology testing on the woman will determine if either had an effect on her to play a role in the incident.
