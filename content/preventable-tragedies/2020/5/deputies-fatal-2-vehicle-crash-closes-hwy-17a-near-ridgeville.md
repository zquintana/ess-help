DORCHESTER COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - The Dorchester County coroner said at least one person died in two-vehicle crash near the Colleton County line involving a vehicle in the water.

The coroner identified the deceased as 56-year-old Jeffrey Allen Collins of Walterboro.

The crash happened on Highway 17A near Sandpit Drive, Dorchester County Sheriff’s Lt. Rick Carson said. The crash involved an SUV and an 18-wheeler.

Highway Patrol officials said the tractor trailer and SUV were both heading northbound when the SUV left the roadway to make a U-turn.

According to troopers, the tractor trailer hit the SUV on the driver’s side door of the vehicle.

The SUV then went off the roadway and into a ditch, a Highway Patrol stated.

The driver of the 18-wheeler, who asked not to be identified, said he was traveling north on Highway 17A toward Summerville when the crash happened.
