A woman was killed Thursday when she was hit by a car after she got out of her possibly disabled car on the eastbound San Bernardino (10) Freeway in West Covina, authorities said.
The 26-year-old El Monte woman was injured about 4:30 a.m. west of Azusa Avenue and died at the scene, according to the California Highway Patrol. Her name was withheld, pending notification of her relatives.
According to the CHP, the woman was driving a 2000 Toyota Camry when she “exited her vehicle within the traffic lanes when the Toyota was possibly experiencing mechanical issues.”
“As (she) was outside of her vehicle … a 2019 Nissan Altima struck (her) …,” the CHP reported.
The Nissan was driven by Dracy Anderson, a 27-year-old Fontana man, who was not injured, the CHP reported. Anderson remained at the scene and was not arrested, the CHP reported.
