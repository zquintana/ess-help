ISHERS, Ind. — Traffic is slowly moving once again on northbound I-69 in Fishers near 116th Street after a semi trailer hit a pedestrian. It occurred around 6 a.m.

Police tell us the victim was alert and conscious when they arrived, and medics transported him to the hospital.

Investigators believe the pedestrian, an 18-year-old man, was standing next to a pickup truck to exchange information due to a previous, minor crash. During the exchange, the semi tractor-trailer hit the truck and victim.

Everyone involved is reportedly cooperating with police and there’s no suspicion of alcohol or drugs being a factor at this point.
