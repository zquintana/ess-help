Galveston police officer, EMT seriously injured when vehicle crashes into wreck scene on Causeway

An off-duty Galveston police officer who was involved in a crash, and an off-duty EMT who was tending to his injuries where each seriously injured when another vehicle crashed into the pair on the Galveston Causeway early Tuesday morning.

At about 12:40 AM the officer was in his personal vehicle headed southbound on Interstate 45 when he struck the center concrete divider wall on the bridge.

A short time later an off duty emergency medical technician who had seen the crash stopped and got out of her car to help the officer who appeared to have been injured.

While she was assisting the officer, who was still in the car, another vehicle crashed into the EMT and officer’s vehicle, Lt. Xavier Hancock said.

The driver of the vehicle that crashed into the EMT and officer remained on the scene until police arrived. That person was not charged or cited, Hancock said.

Because the officer and EMT where in their personal vehicles there was no flashing emergency lights to warn oncoming traffic of the hazard on the bridge.

The officer and EMT were transported to UTMB Health’s John Sealy Hospital emergency Center with serious injuries. Both were stable and responsive as of Tuesday morning, police said.

There’s no indication from police what may have contributed to the single-vehicle crash of the officer’s car.

Thus far no one has been cited or charged in connection to the crash.

Police also did not say if the if they suspect that any of those involved was possibly intoxicated at the time of either crash.
