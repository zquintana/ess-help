KINGSBURG, Calif. (FOX26) â€” An 18-year-old woman died after she was in a single-car crash on Highway 99, leaving her car blocking traffic and was hit by other cars.

CHP says the woman lost control and hit a concrete median barrier just south of Sierra St. in Kingsburg around 10:30 p.m. on Thursday.

Investigators say the woman was not injured in the initial crash but her car was blocking the southbound lanes of Highway 99.

A second vehicle driven by a 24-year-old man from Visalia was unable to stop in time and hit the disabled car.

Just after that, a third vehicle, driven by a 28-year-old man from Fresno also hit her car.

The woman was pinned inside her vehicle until she was extricated by emergency personnel and airlifted to CRMC.

The woman did not survive her injuries.
