---
A 29-year-old Texas man was killed Wednesday night when he left his vehicle after a collision near Fairfield, the California Highway Patrol said.

The Texas man, whose name hasn't been released, was driving a 2019 Chrysler when he collided with a 2020 Kia Forte around 9:10 p.m. on the two-lane connector ramp from westbound Highway 12 to westbound Interstate Highway 80, CHP Officer Miguel Camarena said.
The man fled his disabled Chrysler and ran toward the right shoulder of the ramp where he was struck by a blue Mazda CX-9 at 9:22 p.m. Camarena said.

The Mazda driver stopped and cooperated with the fatal collision investigation. Alcohol or drugs are not suspected as factors in the collision, Camarena said.
