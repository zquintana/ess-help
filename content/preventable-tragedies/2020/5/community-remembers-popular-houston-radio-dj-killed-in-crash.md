HOUSTON â€“ Houstonians are mourning the loss of a popular Bollywood radio DJ that was killed in a crash Monday.

Arif Memon, 58, a well-known DJ for 106.1 HUMFM, was described as being passionate, caring and positive.
According to HPD, the driver of a disabled red Freightliner tractor-trailer had stopped completely in the left shoulder of the Southwest Freeway and placed multiple warning signs along the yellow solid line between the left shoulder and the nearest lane of traffic.

Memon was unable to maintain a single lane and struck the rear of the 18-wheeler, police said. Paramedics pronounced Memon dead at the scene, police said. The driver of the 18-wheeler was not injured.
