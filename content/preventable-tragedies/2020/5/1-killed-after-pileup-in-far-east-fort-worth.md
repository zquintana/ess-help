A man was killed late Sunday in a chain-reaction crash on Texas 183 in Fort Worth, police say.

First responders were called about 9:30 p.m. to the crash along the eastbound lanes of the 15000 block of 183 in Far East Fort Worth.

Early reports from a Fort Worth fire spokesman indicated a driver who pulled over to fix a flat tire was struck by four other vehicles. An 18-wheeler then collided with one of the vehicles in the pileup, killing one person.
