title: "Woman Arrested For Alleged Scott's Law Violation Following Four Accidents on I-80 Near Morris"
---
The Illinois State Police has released information regarding four crashes that occurred on Interstate 80 just west of Brisbin Road on May 22nd.  ISP officials say they responded to a traffic crash at the aforementioned location at 10:07 p.m. A White Toyota Paseo was traveling on Interstate 80 westbound in the left lane. A White Toyota Prius was traveling in the same direction in the right lane. The driver of the Paseo crossed over the lane markings and struck the left rear driver side of the Prius, which ended up in the ditch. The driver of Paseo fled the scene as that vehicle was left abandoned partially in the right lane as well as the right shoulder without hazard lights activated. There were no injuries reported as a result of this crash.

Nearly 30 minutes later, a Gray Chevrolet Traverse was traveling on Interstate 80 westbound in the right lane when they struck the rear end of the abandoned Paseo from the first accident. As a result of that collision, the Traverse traveled across all lanes of traffic before going into the center ditch, while the Paseo also went into the ditch. The driver of Traverse was transported to a local area hospital with minor injuries.
