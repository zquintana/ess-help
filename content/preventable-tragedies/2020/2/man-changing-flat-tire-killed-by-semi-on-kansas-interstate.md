---
OTTAWA, Kan. (AP) -- A Wichita man who was changing a flat tire along the shoulder of an interstate in northeast Kansas died Tuesday after he was hit by a semi-trailer truck, the Kansas Highway Patrol said.

Sidney Leroy Huff, 73, died while changing the tire on Interstate 35 in Franklin County, about 5 miles from Ottawa, the patrol said.

The driver of the truck drove over a white edge line of the light lane and struck Huff, the patrol report said. A passenger in Huff's car was not injured.

The truck driver, Jerry Tiger, 51, of Wichita, kept driving until he was stopped by law enforcement near Gardner, about 15 miles from the crash, the patrol said.
