---

It was a deadly Saturday night on two New Jersey highways as two men were killed in separate crashes, one of them involving a hit and run driver, according to police.

On the New Jersey Turnpike in Secaucus, 33-year-old Jose Peralta was found lying in the highway around 11:50 p.m., according to State Police spokesman Trooper Alejandro Goez.

Goez said the East Newark man had been changing a tire on his car when he was struck by another vehicle that did not stop. The incident happened on the right shoulder of the southbound eastern spur of the Turnpike.

Peralta, who was alone, was pronounced dead at the scene. Police did not have a description of the other vehicle involved.
