One woman was killed and another seriously injured Wednesday when their stalled car was struck by a pickup truck while they were standing outside the vehicle on the shoulder of an Oakland freeway, the California Highway Patrol said.Officers said they did not know why the car was stalled or why the pickup truck collided with it. The impact caused the struck car to slam into the women, who were not identified.

The collision occurred at 12:20 p.m. on southbound Highway 13 just north of Broadway Terrace, said CHP officer Sean Layton. The collision shut down two of the three lanes of traffic for nearly two hours. The injured woman was being treated at Highland Hospital in Oakland.

The unidentified driver of the pickup truck was treated at the scene for moderate injuries and is cooperating with authorities, who ruled out drugs or alcohol as factors in the collision.

This collision is still under investigation. If you have any information regarding this collision, please contact the Oakland CHP Office at 510-457-2875.
