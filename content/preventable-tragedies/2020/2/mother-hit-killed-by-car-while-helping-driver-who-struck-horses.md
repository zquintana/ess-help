JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – A woman who stopped to help after another driver struck and killed two horses on U.S. 301 was hit and killed after she got out of her car, the Florida Highway Patrol said.
According to the FHP report, a Toyota 4Runner was headed south on 301 in the Nassau County area when it hit two horses standing in the southbound lanes of the highway. The horses died from their injuries, troopers said.

Mellisa Nault, 38 of Callahan, was driving her Hyundai Genesis behind the 4Runner and saw the crash. She stopped to help, got out of her car and started to walk over to the other driver.

But at the same moment, a red Kia Forte that was also headed south on 301 hit one of the horses lying in the roadway, flipping the Kia, which hit Nault and her Hyundai. A 15-year-old girl was still inside the Hyundai when it was hit, survived.

According to Nault’s husband, Robert, the 15-year-old was their daughter. She tried to save her mother, but Nault died at the scene.
