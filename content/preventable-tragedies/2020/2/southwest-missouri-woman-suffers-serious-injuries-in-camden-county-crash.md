A Hollister, Missouri, woman suffered serious injuries when a semi-truck's trailer hit her vehicle, which had crashed on an icy road Wednesday night.

The Missouri State Highway Patrol said Ronda Bethell, 60, was a passenger in a Chevrolet Trailblazer that lost control on an ice-covered Highway 5 outside Camdenton. The vehicle hit a guardrail and was partially blocking a lane when it stopped, according to an online crash report. The driver, Scott Bethell, 63, also of Hollister, suffered minor injuries.

The patrol said a tractor-trailer driven by Nurlan Tashtanov, 32, of Philadelphia, then hit the Trailblazer with its trailer.
