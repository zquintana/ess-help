title: Two people dead after being trapped in wrecked cars for hours after TWO HUNDRED vehicle pileup on Canadian highway during sudden blizzard
---
Two people were killed in a massive pileup involving about 200 vehicles on a busy highway south of Montreal, according to Canadian police.

Authorities confirmed that the two people, who have not been identified, had been traveling in the same vehicle when it collided with a tank truck on Wednesday during the 200-car pileup in La Prairie, Quebec. 

Stéphane Tremblay, spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec said the pair were trapped in their car for hours after the crash before emergency services could pull them from the wreckage. 

'We know that these people were involved in a collision with a tank truck, which made the rescue operation more difficult for first responders,' she said. 

The cause of the crash has so far been linked to whiteout conditions, with snow and high winds reducing driver visibility to zero without warning.
