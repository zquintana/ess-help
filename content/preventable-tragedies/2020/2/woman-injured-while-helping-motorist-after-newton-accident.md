Police said a car hit a power pole in the 1600 block of South Kansas Avenue around 10:15 p.m. Saturday.   A woman stopped to help the driver, who was having a medical problem. A passing semi hit some downed power lines and the lines then struck the woman outside the car.

Kristy Hermstein was taken to Wesley Medical Center in Wichita, where she was in critical but stable condition.   Family friends report that her legs had to be amputated below the knee and she also had a broken hand.    The driver of the car was taken to Newton Medical Center.
