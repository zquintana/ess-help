title: Good Samaritan Survives 75-foot Fall Off Highway Bridge
---
Jeremiah Cribb, 24, was driving a FedEx truck early on Wednesday morning on Interstate 85 in Rowan County when he saw a driver stranded in the fast lane, news outlets reported.

Cribb said he got out to help the driver but soon noticed a tractor-trailer barreling toward them, so he jumped out of the way to avoid getting hit. Cribb thought he was jumping onto a grass median of the same height but instead jumped off the Yadkin River Bridge and landed on a sandbar 75 feet below.
Cribb has three fractured ribs and a collapsed lung. He is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days.
