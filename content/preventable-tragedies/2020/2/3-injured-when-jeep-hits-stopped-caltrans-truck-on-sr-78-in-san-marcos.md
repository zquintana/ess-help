SAN MARCOS â€” A Caltrans worker and two other people were injured, one of them seriously, on Tuesday afternoon when a Jeep crashed into the back of a stopped Caltrans pickup on the shoulder of state Route 78 in San Marcos, authorities said.

The crash prompted authorities to issue a traffic alert and shut down parts of east SR-78 at Nordahl Road until about 6:30 p.m., snarling the evening rush-hour commute in parts of North County.
