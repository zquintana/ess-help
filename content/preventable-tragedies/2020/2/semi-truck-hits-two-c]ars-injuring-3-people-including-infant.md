WALKER, TX, (February 13, 2020) - Three people, including a 4-month-old boy, were injured in a crash with a tractor-trailer on Thursday, February 13th in Walker County.

The accident occurred at about 11:30 a.m. on Interstate 45. The driver of a car and a pickup truck were stopped near mile marker 130 after a crash. At that time, the barreling semi-truck didn't see the stopped traffic and slammed into the stopped vehicles.
