One man is hospitalized after he and another man were struck by a vehicle on highway 38 two miles west of Marshfield late Saturday night.

The Missouri State Highway Patrol says both had exited their cars after one broke down when a third vehicle smashed into the back of the first car, causing it to hit the second car, causing it to hit the men.

Everyone else involved sustained minor injuries.
