PITT COUNTY, N.C. (WITN) – Troopers say weather was a factor in the death of a Farmville man who was struck and killed by his own car this morning.

Kevin Sugg, 46, was involved in a two-car crash on U.S. 264 and Wesley Church Road near Farmville around 7:30 a.m.

Sugg’s car was disabled in the median, according to Trooper Noah Miles, and the man got out to speak to a witness.

Miles says while the two were outside their vehicles, an eastbound SUV ran off the left side of the highway, hit a guard rail and struck Sugg’s car.

The man’s car then hit Sugg and the witness. Sugg was killed while the witness wasn’t taken to the hospital.
