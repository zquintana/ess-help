title: Good Samaritan hit while trying to help people involved in car crash on I-95
---

A good Samaritan was hit while trying to help people involved in a car crash near the 
scene of a vehicle fire on Interstate 95 northbound in Foxborough on Monday.

A man stopped near exit 8 near the Foxborough/Mansfield line to check on the occupants of 
two cars involved in a rear-end collision when a third vehicle crashed into one of the 
cars, state police said.

The impact knocked the good Samaritan, who had been standing next to the driverâ€™s side 
window of one of the vehicles involved in the crash, to the ground.
