title: Semi crash spills Tastykakes, donuts on I-75 in Hernando County
---


A fiery crash involving a semi-truck shut down all three northbound lanes of Interstate 75 in Hernando County, authorities said.

The Florida Highway Patrol said a driver left their Mercedes disabled after they were involved in a crash in the southbound lanes of the Interstate near mile marker 303.

The semi-truck did not see the Mercedes and slammed into the back of the car, then went spinning into the northbound lanes of the interstate.
