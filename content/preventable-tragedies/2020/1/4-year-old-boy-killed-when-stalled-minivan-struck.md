title: 4-Year-Old Boy Killed When Stalled Minivan Struck
---

4-year-old boy was killed Friday night when his familyâ€™s stalled vehicle was hit from behind, Euless police say.

Police said a mother and her four children were in a Chrysler Pacifica in the left express lane of the 800 block of West Airport Freeway when an SUV struck them.

Police think the family was hit when traffic, which had slowed, started up again while their vehicle stalled.
