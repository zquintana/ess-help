A motorist, who got out of his sport utility vehicle following a crash on the 91 freeway in Long Beach Tuesday evening, Jan. 21, died at a hospital after at least one other vehicle hit him, authorities said Wednesday. The 21-year-old manâ€™s name was withheld pending notification of his family.

The Los Angeles resident was driving a 1998 Honda CR-V that collided with another vehicle about 10:45 p.m. Tuesday on the westbound 91, west of Cherry Avenue, said California Highway Patrol Officer Marcos Iniguez, of the Santa Fe Springs Area office. Both vehicles stopped. The L.A. man got out of the Honda, and a short time later at least one other vehicle hit him, Iniguez said.
