title: Good Samaritan struck on freeway while helping occupants of disabled vehicle
---

A preliminary investigation revealed a Toyota with three occupants was disabled in the right distress lane â€” and a pickup truck with two occupants stopped at the scene to assist.

While the driver of the pickup was standing outside of his vehicle, the driver of a Chevy Malibu coming from the east to the south ramp lost control and struck him.
