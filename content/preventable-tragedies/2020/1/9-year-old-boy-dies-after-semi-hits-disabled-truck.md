title: 9-year-old boy dies after semi hits disabled truck
---

A Ford F-150, with three passengers, was disabled without lights on in the northbound lane of the highway after hitting two elk, according to a crash narrative from the Montana Highway Patrol.

A semi, also driving north, didn’t see the truck in time and crashed into it. The pickup was pushed off the right side of the road and a 9-year-old boy was pronounced dead on scene from the impact.
