CYPRESS, Texas — Three Good Samaritans who stopped to help at a crash scene were badly injured when a suspected drunk driver plowed right into them.

Deputies told us he plowed into the group in his Toyota Tundra, first striking Ramirez’s female friend, who was standing next to a car with its hazard lights on
