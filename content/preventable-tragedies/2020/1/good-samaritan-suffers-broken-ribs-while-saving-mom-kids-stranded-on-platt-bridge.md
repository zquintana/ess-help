PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A good Samaritan was rushed to the hospital after being struck on the Platt Bridge in Philadelphia just moments after he helped save a stranded mother and her two young kids.

Lou Gusbar continues to recover from injuries suffered around 11 p.m. Tuesday as he was standing next to Shauntae Brown's stalled van when it was hit at a high rate of speed and caught fire.
Brown and her sons, ages 4 and 8, had been stuck on the left lane of the bridge for more than 10 minutes after their van stopped working.

She said other drivers were stopping as they approached and narrowly missing them. One driver actually crashed into another car and lost a tire, she said.
