A Chicago woman was killed early Saturday as she was standing alongside a disabled vehicle on U.S. Interstate 80 near Earlham and a passing motorist struck the vehicle.

Carmen Benitez, 56, of Chicago, a passenger in Galicia’s vehicle, “was standing outside the vehicle when it was struck” by a 2019 Cadillac Escalade, driven by Ali Elride, 38, of Queens County, New York.
