At about 1:45 p.m. police had surrounded a vehicle on northbound I-25 just north of the Bijou exit. Someone was reportedly outside of a truck when they were hit.

The call for the crash came in at about 12:40 p.m. Investigators are reporting a moving truck was traveling northbound on I-25 when the vehicle sustained a flat tire. An employee went to the front of the truck and peered around the driver’s side when he was hit by the side mirror of a passing truck. The driver of the truck did not stay on scene.

The victim was taken to the hospital and treated for injuries that aren’t considered life-threatening.
