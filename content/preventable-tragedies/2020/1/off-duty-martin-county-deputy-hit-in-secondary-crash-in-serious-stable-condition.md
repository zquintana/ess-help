---

The off-duty Martin County sheriff’s deputy seriously injured in a secondary crash early Saturday morning has been identified as Shawn Green.

Green was assisting the victim of a rollover crash around 1:20 a.m. Saturday — along the Martin Grade Scenic Highway (County Road 714) west of Southwest Allapatah Road (County Road 609) — when he was struck by another vehicle.

Green had notified dispatch of the initial crash and a responding deputy found him laying in the roadway. Police say he suffered facial injuries along with multiple broken bones.

The driver in the second crash was hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries.
