title: Woman dies after being hit by two cars near 35th Avenue and Bethany Home Road
---

Phoenix police say the victim, only identified as a 34-year-old woman, was crossing 35th Avenue mid-block when she was struck by two vehicles headed southbound. The woman is believed to have stopped in the roadway when the crash happened.

Police say the victim was taken to the hospital but died a short time later.

The first driver that hit the victim reportedly saw her and tried to avoid hitting her, and the second driver struck the woman after she had already been hit.

Both drivers stayed at the scene and were not impaired. Police say speed does not appear to be a factor in the collision, either.
