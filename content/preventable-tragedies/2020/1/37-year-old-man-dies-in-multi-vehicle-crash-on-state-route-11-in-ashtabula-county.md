Troopers said a driver of a Dodge Ram stopped to help a driver of disabled Ford 550 truck that was stuck in the median on State Route 11. The driver of the Dodge had stopped to assist by pulling the disabled F-550 from the median.

Once the disabled truck was removed from the median, it rolled across the northbound lanes of State Route 11 and was struck by a 2008 Ford F-150 driven by Brandon White, 37, of Austinburg.
