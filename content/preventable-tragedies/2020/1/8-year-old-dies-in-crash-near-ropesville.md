An 8-year-old child was killed in a crash that happened on FM 41 east of Ropesville.

A truck tractor that was towing a semi-trailer was stopped on FM 41 with hazard lights activated at around 8:30 a.m. on Thursday, January 2nd.

A 2017 Ford pickup approached the rear of the semi-trailer without realizing it was stopped, and attempted to veer left to avoid striking it. The collision was unavoidable, and the Ford struck the rear of the semi-trailer.

The driver of the Ford, 35-year-old Rhett Green of Lubbock was treated at the scene for his injuries, but his 8-year-old passenger was pronounced dead.
