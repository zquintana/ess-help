title: Woman killed in single-car crash on Pleasant Grove Road
---


One woman was killed in a single-car crash on Pleasant Grove Road Wednesday.

Family members began to look for the woman when she had not arrived home on time. They found the crashed vehicle and called the Sheriff’s Office.

The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department responded to the crash on Pleasant Grove Road near Cypress Circle just after 4:30 P.M. Wednesday.

When they arrived, deputies found a heavily damaged vehicle that had left the roadway and went into a ravine. A female was the only person in the vehicle, and she was pronounced deceased on the scene.

Based on the preliminary investigation, it appears that the woman might have fallen asleep while driving.
