title: 10-year-old boy dies after semi hits disabled truck
---
10-year-old boy died Thursday night near Cameron in Madison County after a semi truck hit a disabled pickup on the side of the road.

The crash happened just before 7:40 p.m. on Thursday on Highway 287 at mile marker 25 near Cameron. 

A Ford F-150 with three passengers was disabled without lights in the northbound lane of the highway after hitting two elk, according to a crash narrative from the Montana Highway Patrol. 

A semi, also driving north, didn't see the truck in time and crashed into it. The pickup was pushed off the right side of the road and a 10-year-old boy was pronounced dead on scene from the impact.
