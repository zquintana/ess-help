title: Woman, child killed in crash involving tractor-trailer on I-95
---

A Pennsylvania woman and child are dead after a crash in Sussex County early Wednesday morning. State police were called to the crash on Interstate 95 at mile marker 25 around 4:20 a.m. Troopers on scene determined a sedan and a tractor-trailer were involved.

Investigators say the driver of the sedan experienced mechanical problems and stopped in the right lane of travel without turning on the hazards. While stopped, a tractor-trailer hit the vehicle from behind, pushing it onto the shoulder. The driver of the tractor-trailer lost control, slid off the road and overturned.

The driver of the sedan, 57-year-old Melanie Tapper, was pronounced dead at the scene, along with a girl who was in the front passenger seat. Police have not released the passengerâ€™s name because she is a minor.
