title: String of Vehicles Involved in Deadly Hit-and-Run on I-5
---


A driver of a black Toyota Tacoma pickup truck was speeding in the fast lane of northbound I-5 just north of State Route 54 when he illegally tried to pass a red car by using the center emergency lane around 4:52 a.m., California Highway Patrol said.

In the emergency lane was a disabled car. The pickup truck struck the stalled vehicle and the red car he was trying to pass, CHP said.

Minutes later, while those three vehicles were stopped due to the crash, a grey SUV slammed into the black pickup truck.
