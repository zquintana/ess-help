title: Good Samaritan killed while helping teen in broken-down car
---

A 57-year-old man died after stopping in Suffolk County to help a teen in a broken-down SUV, police said Sunday.

Cops said the 18-year-old man was driving his 1998 Nissan Pathfinder west on Motor Parkway, between Hoffman Lane and Veterans Memorial Highway, around 6 p.m. Saturday when the vehicle broke down in the road.

The 57-year-old Bay Shore man, who police identified as Federico Oviedo, pulled up behind the SUV in his 2003 Toyota minivan to help the teen, according to cops.

While the two were getting tools from the trunk at about 6:20 p.m., they were hit by a 2001 Dodge Durango driven by a 22-year-old woman, police said.

The man died at the scene, according to officials. The 18-year-old was taken to Stony Brook University Hospital where he was expected to survive. No arrests have been made.
