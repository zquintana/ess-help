title: Dropped cigarette leads to three-vehicle crash
---


Janett McGahey, 41, of Punta Gorda, reached for the cigarette and veered right onto the shoulder, striking the left side of a Chevy 2500 driven by a 39-year-old man from Lehigh Acres, according to a press release.

The Chevy was parked behind a disabled vehicle on the right paved shoulder of Interstate 75 in Charlotte County, with lighted warning signs and traffic cones.

After striking that vehicle, McGahey then continued north, striking an 82-year-old pedestrian, as well as the disabled vehicle.

McGahey was cited for a violation of the move over law.
