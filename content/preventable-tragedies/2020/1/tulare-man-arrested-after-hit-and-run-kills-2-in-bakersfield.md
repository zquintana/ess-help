---

CHP says the big rig, driven by 53-year-old Aurelio Castaneda of Tulare, drove away from the scene of the crash, leaving the Hyundai blocking traffic with no lights on.

After nearly 5-minutes, an oncoming SUV crashed into the disabled Hyundai.

A 20-year-old man in the back of the Hyundai received major injuries in the second crash; the driver of the SUV received only mild injuries.
