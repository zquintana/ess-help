GSP says the accident victim, Ayuba Cunningham, was parked on the east shoulder on State Route 25 north at Hutchinson Island Road with his lights and hazard lights on.

When Cunningham walked towards the front of the car to see what the issue was, Amber Black failed to maintain her lane and started to drive on the east shoulder.

Black’s car struck Cunningham’s, pushing his car 22 feet on the shoulder and striking Cunningham. He jumped over the concrete barrier and was holding onto a support beam over the Savannah River.
