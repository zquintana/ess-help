A 34-year-old motorcyclist died after rear-ending a disabled car on a Bronx highway, officials said Wednesday.

Joel Ramirez Payano was heading south on the Major Deegan Expressway near the E. 233rd St. exit in Woodlawn Heights about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday when he slammed into the back of a 2007 Toyota Prius with a flat tire in the left lane. EMS rushed him to St. Barnabas Hospital, where he died a short time later.
