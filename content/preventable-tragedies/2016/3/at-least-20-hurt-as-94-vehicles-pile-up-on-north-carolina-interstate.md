title: At Least 20 Hurt as 94 Vehicles Pile Up on North Carolina Interstate
---


Blinding sun, rain and rubbernecking were blamed for a chain of accidents involving almost 100 vehicles along a stretch of interstate in North Carolina on Sunday evening, injuring at least 20 people and delaying travel late into the night.

Incredibly, none of the injuries was reported to be serious in the series of wrecks, which the state Transportation Department tabulated at nine, involving 94 vehicles, along a six-mile stretch of freeway where westbound Interstate 40 and southbound Interstate 85 are combined in Alamance County, east of Burlington.
