Marengo, IL -- September 15, 2021, a 25-year-old Woodstock woman was killed in a four-vehicle collision involving a tractor-trailer in McHenry County.

Authorities say the incident happened around 4:30 p.m. along State Route 23 at River Road. Preliminary investigation suggests a Kenworth 18-wheeler was southbound on the highway and approached the River Road intersection when the victim allegedly pulled her Pontiac G6 onto the roadway into the truck's path. The Kenworth struck the Pontiac on its driver's side. As the two vehicles came to rest they were subsequently hit by a northbound Nissan Rogue and a Jeep Cherokee.

The Pontiac driver was pronounced dead at the scene. The Jeep driver received minor injuries and was transported to an area hospital. The Kenworth driver and both occupants of the Nissan were treated and released at the scene.

The crash remains under investigation but impairment is not believed to be a factor.

No further information is currently available.
