Police said two vehicles, a Toyota Corolla and a Nissan Frontier, were involved in a minor collision in the westbound lanes. The drivers, both men, stopped in a moving lane of traffic and exited their vehicles. Thatâ€™s when the driver of a larger Chevrolet pickup slammed into the stopped vehicles and drivers.

The driver of the Chevrolet pickup told police they were following another vehicle prior to the major collision, and they were not able to see the stopped vehicles.
