Hesperia, CA -- October 4, 2021, two truck drivers were injured when a tractor-trailer hit a disabled box truck on Interstate 15 in Hesperia.

Authorities say the incident happened around 7:55 a.m. on northbound I-15 between Joshua and Main streets. Preliminary investigation suggests a Hino 195 box truck was disabled on the right shoulder of the roadway when, for unknown reasons, a Freightliner Cascadia tractor-trailer rear-ended it. The impact caused the Hino truck to overturn on its side.

Both drivers successfully exited their trucks after the crash. Both complained of pain and were transported to area hospitals for evaluation and treatment.

No further information is currently available.
