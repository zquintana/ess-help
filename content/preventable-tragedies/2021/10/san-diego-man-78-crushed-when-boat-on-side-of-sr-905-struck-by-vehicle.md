title: "San Diego Man, 78, Crushed When Boat On Side of SR-905 Struck By Vehicle"
---
An elderly San Diego man was apparently crushed to death on state Route 905 Saturday while trying to fix the trailer of a small fishing boat being towed by a pickup.

The crash happened about 6:45 a.m. Saturday on westbound State Route 905 just east of Interstate 5, according to California Highway Patrol Officer Sal Castro.

“A Chevy truck towing a small fishing boat had broken down and was partially blocking the slow lane of traffic,” Castro said. “A passenger from inside the Chevy exited the vehicle and was attempting to fix the issue.

The driver of a Honda CRV approaching the scene didn’t see the truck blocking the lane and struck the back of the fishing boat and trailer, which hit the man, 78.

“This impact pushed the boat/trailer into the passenger, causing fatal injuries,” Castro said.

A witness in a silver Kia told the CHP she had a recording of the crash on her dashcam.

The driver of the CRV remained on scene and provided information to investigators. Castro said officers determined the Honda driver was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It was not known if fog had reduced visibility on the roadway, and factored into the crash.

Authorities called the San Diego County Medical Examiner’s Office to the scene at 7:15 a.m.

The CHP closed the two right lanes of westbound SR-905 for four hours while officers investigated the collision. The fast lane remained open and traffic was not affected, the officer said.
