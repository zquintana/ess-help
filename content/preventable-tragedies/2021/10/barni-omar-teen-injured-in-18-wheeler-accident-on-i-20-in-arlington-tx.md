title: "Barni Omar, Teen Injured in 18-Wheeler Accident on I-20 in Arlington, TX"
---
Arlington, TX -- October 2, 2021, 27-year-old Barni Omar and a teen girl were injured when a semi-truck hit their disabled car on Interstate 20 in Arlington.

Authorities say the incident happened around 12:10 a.m. on I-20 (Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway) near Bowman Springs Road. Preliminary investigation suggests Omar was driving a Toyota Corolla west in the 6700 block of the freeway in the far right lane. Reports indicate the vehicle was traveling very slowly along the 70mph roadway due to having a flat back tire.

As it passed over the crest of a slight hill and entered a right-hand curve, the Toyota was hit from behind by a Freightliner semi-truck towing a trailer. The impact pushed the car off the roadway to the right; it passed through both lanes of the adjacent I-20 entrance ramp from US-287. The truck then veered left across all travel lanes, hitting the inside jersey barrier. It overturned and slid back across the travel lanes before coming to rest on its driver's side.

A 13-year-old girl in the Toyota suffered serious injuries in the crash. Barni Omar and the truck driver both received minor injuries. A 19-year-old Toyota passenger, Maryan Abdi Omar, was unhurt.

No further information is currently available.
