NEWPORT, Carteret County — A car crash this morning in Newport sent one person to the hospital.

Fire and rescue officials on-scene said a car pulled off the road to call a tow truck for an abandoned vehicle when a white Dodge Challenger hit the good Samaritan’s car.

North Carolina Highway Patrol said the driver of the Challenger kept going for about 400 yards--only stopping when they lost a tire.

The driver left the scene and 1 person in the car that was hit was taken to the hospital.
