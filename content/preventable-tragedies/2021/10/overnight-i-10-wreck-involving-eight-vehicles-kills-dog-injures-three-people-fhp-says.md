title: "Overnight I-10 wreck involving eight vehicles kills dog, injures three people, FHP says"
---
An overnight wreck involving eight vehicles left three people with minor injuries and breifly shut down all westbound traffic on I-10 in Jefferson County, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. 

The series of events that occurred around 1:50 a.m. Friday morning began when a sedan hit a dog, rendering it "inoperable" in the middle of the highway. Another sedan then crashed into the vehicle.

Then a semi-tractor, driving in the inside lane, smashed into both cars before colliding with "the concrete barrier wall, causing a large debris field," a FHP sergeant wrote in a narrative of the crash. 

The debris quickly scattered across the roadway and hit six other vehicles. 

FHP Sergeant John Tallman said the stray dog was killed. He did not know its breed.

Traffic was diverted off exit 217 for a little over an hour, he added. 

The Jefferson County Sheriffâ€™s Office, Jefferson County Fire Rescue and Florida Department of Transportation assisted FHP at the scene, wrote Tallman in a crash narrative.
