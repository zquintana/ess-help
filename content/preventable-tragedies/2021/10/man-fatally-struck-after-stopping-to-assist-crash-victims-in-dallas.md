title: "Man Fatally Struck After Stopping to Assist Crash Victims in Dallas"
---
A man who stopped to check on the people involved in a crash was struck and killed by another vehicle on Interstate 35E in Dallas early Monday, authorities say.

The initial crash happened just before 3 a.m. on the northbound side of I-35E near Commonwealth Drive, the Dallas County Sheriff's Office said.

The sheriff's office said a white Mazda hit a guard rail on the right shoulder, went back into traffic and was hit by a white Kia.

A 23-year-old man in a gold Chevrolet Suburban then stopped to check on the drivers of the two vehicles when he was hit by a black Honda, authorities said.
