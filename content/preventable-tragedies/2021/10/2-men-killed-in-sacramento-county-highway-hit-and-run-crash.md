SACRAMENTO COUNTY, Calif. —
The California Highway Patrol says it's looking for the driver who killed two people in a Monday evening crash in Sacramento County and fled the scene.

CHP's North Sacramento division said it got a call around 6:05 p.m. about a crash on westbound Interstate 80 west of Madison Avenue. Officers who responded learned that a green GMC pickup truck was traveling westbound and, for reasons unknown, went off the road and hit a Nissan Sentra and a Ford F-150.

CHP said the Ford and Nissan were disabled before the crash on the right shoulder of the road. A 26-year-old man and 63-year-old man — both from Sacramento — were standing by the disabled vehicles and were hit by the green pickup truck. The GMC then went back into traffic and hit a Honda Pilot that was also traveling westbound.The driver of the GMC then got out of their vehicle and ran away toward the direction of the nearby Scandia Fun Center, CHP said.

The 26-year-old died at the scene, and the 63-year-old was transported to the hospital where he was declared dead at 6:40 p.m., CHP said. A passenger inside the GMC was also transported with serious injuries.

It is unknown what caused the crash, but CHP said witnesses described the driver of the GMC as a balding male who was wearing blue jeans, no shirt and had tattoos.
