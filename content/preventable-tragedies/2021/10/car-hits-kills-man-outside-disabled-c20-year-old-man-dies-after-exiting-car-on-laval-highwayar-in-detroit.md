Laval police are investigating after a 20-year-old man was hit and killed along Autoroute 15 near Saint-Martin Boulevard.

The victim was a passenger in a car that stopped by the side of the highway, where the driver let him step out.

Police received a call around 4:50 a.m. regarding a southbound car along the highway that hit the man. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Stephanie Beshara, a spokesperson for Laval police, says the reason the victim left the car is unknown.

"We'd like to remind people that it's very dangerous, it's not secure to come out of the vehicle or to stop on the highway for any reason," she said. "It's better to get off at the first exit that you see and get out of the car in a secure zone."

The 23-year-old woman who was driving the victim was transported to hospital to be treated for shock.

The other driver, a woman in her 20s, wasn't hurt.
