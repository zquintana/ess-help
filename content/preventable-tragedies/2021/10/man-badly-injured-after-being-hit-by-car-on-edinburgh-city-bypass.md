The car failed to stop and continued westbound on the Bypass towards Dreghorn Junction.

The man was taken to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh for treatment to serious injuries.

The incident happened shortly after 1.15am on Sunday morning and road policing officers are now appealing for information.The road reopened shortly before 4am following an investigation.

“I would urge anyone who believes they may have seen a vehicle matching this description or something similar to get in touch.

“We would also be keen to speak to anyone who was on the Bypass early on Sunday morning and may have dashcam footage to come forward.

“Anyone with information can call 101, quoting incident 0282 of October 3.”
