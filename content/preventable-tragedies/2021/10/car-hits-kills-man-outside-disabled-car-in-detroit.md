WAYNE COUNTY, MI - A man who stepped out of his disabled car on a Detroit freeway was hit and killed by another vehicle early Sunday, state police said.

Troopers responded about 5:25 a.m. Oct. 17 on southbound M-39 north of Plymouth Road, said the Michigan State Police Metro Detroit post.

Investigators initially determined that the man left his disabled car and was standing outside on the freeway, police said. A vehicle then struck him, police said, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

The vehicle that hit the man caught fire and stopped shortly after making contact, police said. The driver did not suffer any injuries, police said, but was taken to a hospital for a blood draw to determine if any substances contributed to the incident.

The deceased man has not yet been identified.

Southbound M-39 was closed south of I-96 while officials conducted the crash investigation. All lanes were reopened at 10:41 a.m., police said.
