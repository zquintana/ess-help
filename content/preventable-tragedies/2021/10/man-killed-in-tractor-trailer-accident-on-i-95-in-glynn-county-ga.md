Glynn County, GA -- October 28, 2021, one person was killed as the result of a multi-vehicle accident on I-95 involving 18-wheelers.

Investigators were called to the scene of the crash at around 5:20 a.m. near mile marker 40. The events began when a Nissan Sentra traveling southbound on the interstate had a tire go flat. The Sentra then crashed into the guardrail. A Tesla, followed by a Volvo tractor-trailer, then hit the Sentra. After this, a man in a Nissan Altima swerved to avoid the Sentra, then hit the median guardrail. A Peterbilt tractor-trailer then crashed into the side of the Altima. A Toyota 4Runner also crashed.

Due to the collisions, the driver of the Altima sustained fatal injuries. It's unclear if anyone else was hurt. Police have yet to determine factors contributing to the crash.
