A fatal crash on southbound Interstate 5 near the Main Gate of Joint Base Lewis-McChord caused traffic delays Wednesday morning. The right two lanes of traffic were blocked due the collision, reported at about 6:40 a.m. A driver died after colliding with a semi truck, Washington State Patrol trooper Robert Reyer said. Traffic was backed up all the way to state Route 512 in Lakewood by about 9:10 a.m. Reyers said a pickup traveling south in the left lane crossed all lanes of traffic going right and struck the left rear of the semiâ€™s trailer. He said the semi truck was stopped on the right shoulder. The pickup collided with another vehicle after it hit the semi truck.

The driver of the pickup was declared dead at the scene. None of the other drivers were injured. WSP troopers, WSDOT and others responded to the scene.
