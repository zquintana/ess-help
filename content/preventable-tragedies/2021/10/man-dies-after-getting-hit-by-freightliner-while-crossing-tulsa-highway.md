TULSA, Okla. (KTUL) â€” A driver died after getting hit by a tractor-trailer while walking away from his crashed vehicle on the Inner Dispersal Loop in Tulsa.

Troopers say it happened around 11:15 p.m. on US Highway 412 at L.L. Tisdale Parkway.

According to Oklahoma Highway Patrol, a man was driving southbound on the Tisdale when he attempted to take the ramp to go eastbound on the north leg of the IDL, but he lost control of his car and crashed into the concrete barrier on the ramp.

The driver then got out and abandoned his car and tried to cross the eastbound lanes of US 412 when he was hit by a Freightliner tractor-trailer.The tractor-trailer stopped immediately and waited for emergency responders.

When troopers arrived, the man was being taken to a nearby hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

Tulsa police say the man's family drove by the scene shortly after midnight when they saw his car and stopped to ask about his condition. They were notified at the scene.

No charges will be filed against the driver of the Freightliner.
