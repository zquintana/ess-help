ORANGEBURG COUNTY, S.C. â€” The Orangeburg County coroner has identified the person killed early Friday morning in an accident on I-26 that also sent a tractor-trailer into oncoming traffic.

According to South Carolina Highway Patrol Lance Corporal Tyler Tidwell, the crash happened around 5:15 a.m. in the westbound lanes of I-26 about five miles outside of Bowman. The coroner added that this is also near the exit to Holly Springs.Investigators believe that a 2012 Kia Optima driven by 23-year-old Thomas F. Jackson of Orangeburg had attempted to overtake a 2015 Peterbilt tractor-trailer. However, the two vehicles ended up making contact, sending the Peterbilt off the road to the left and into the eastbound lanes. The truck ultimately crashed into a tree and the driver was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.

However, a second collision occurred involving the Optima when a westbound Freightliner tractor-trailer hit the car, sending both into the grass on the right side of the road. The driver of the Freightliner was uninjured, however, Jackson died at the scene. Highway patrol notes indicate he was not wearing a seatbelt.

The South Carolina Highway Patrol is still investigating the crash.
