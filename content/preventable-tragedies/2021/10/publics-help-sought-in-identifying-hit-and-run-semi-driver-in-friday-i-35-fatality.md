The Kansas Highway Patrol is seeking the publicâ€™s assistance in identifying a semi involved in a hit-and-run fatality accident on Interstate 35 in Franklin County on Friday night.

According to the patrol, a Jeep and Dodge Ram traveling southbound became involved in a road rage incident.

The driver of the Dodge Ram began tailgating the Jeep, would speed up and drive beside the Jeep, then slow down and get behind the Jeep. This went on for several miles until the Dodge Ram changed lanes in front of the Jeep and came to a stop in the right lane at mile marker 193, forcing the Jeep to stop.

The driver of the Dodge Ram exited her vehicle and began walking to the driver-side window of the Jeep while shouting.According to occupants of the Jeep, and an independent witness, an unknown commercial semi pulling a trailer sideswiped the rear driver side quarter panel of the Jeep and hit the driver of the Dodge Ram while she was standing at the driver side window of the Jeep.

The truck continued southbound on I-35. The independent witness stated she believed the semi possibly had a blue bull rack cattle trailer.

The crash occurred at 8:23 p.m. near Tennessee Road.

The driver of the 2019 Jeep Compass, Adrion Micheal Self, and two passengers, Amanda Joan Soule, 22, and a 5-month-old infant boy, all of Emporia, were not hurt.The patrol identified the driver of the 2021 Dodge Ram 2500 as Lori Anne Maxwell, 54, of Gloversville, New York. She died at the scene.

Anyone with information regarding the crash or the truck is asked to call Technical Trooper William Bailiff at (785) 217-3359.
