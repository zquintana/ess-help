FRESNO, Calif. (KSEE/KGPE) – A driver was killed Monday after a truck crashed into a disabled vehicle on a highway in Selma, according to the California Highway Patrol.

The crash happened around 4 p.m. in the area of Highway 99 and Floral Avenue.

While investigating, officers say they learned that a 27-year-old man was sitting in his car in the center divider of the highway, causing traffic to move slowly prior to the crash.Officers say a 65-year-old man was approaching the slow-moving traffic and tried to hit his brakes, but was unable to slow down in time due to his speed.

To avoid hitting the cars in the traffic jam, officials say the driver of the truck swerved toward the center median and ended up slamming into the back of the 27-year-old man’s vehicle.

The driver of the vehicle was reportedly not wearing a seatbelt and received major injuries.

A short time later, officers say the driver passed away from his injuries at the scene.

Authorities say alcohol or drugs don’t appear to be a factor, but there was heavy rainfall causing wet roadway conditions at the time of the crash.
