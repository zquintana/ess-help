A 2013 Ford F-150 being driven by 37-year-old Adam K. Whyde, of Beech Grove, stopped on the shoulder of I-65.

A 1998 Peterbilt tractor pulling a trailer, driven by 43-year-old Lee H. Muller, of Danville, Kentucky approached the scene while traveling north on I-65.  Muller attempted to take evasive action to avoid the vehicles and pedestrians in the roadway.  Muller’s vehicle struck Loquercio’s vehicle, Jenkins-Newson’s vehicle, and Grayson’s motorcycle.  Muller’s vehicle also struck the injured motorcyclist Grayson and Whyde, who were providing medical care to Grayson in the roadway.

Grayson sustained fatal injuries in the crash.  He was pronounced deceased at the scene by the Bartholomew County Coroner’s Office.  Whyde sustained serious injuries in the crash.  He was flown from the scene to an Indianapolis area hospital for treatment.  Loquercio sustained minor injuries when he was struck by debris.  He was treated for his injuries.
