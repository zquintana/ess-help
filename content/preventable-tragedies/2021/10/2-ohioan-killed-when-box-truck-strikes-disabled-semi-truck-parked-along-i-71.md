Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers are investigating the crash that involved two commercial trucks headed northbound near milepost 195 on I-71, according to an OSHP media release.

The crash occurred shortly after 3:30 a.m. after a 2017 International semi-tractor trailer stopped along the northbound berm on I-71, the release said.

Two passengers in the box truck, Nicholas Paul Holmes, 30, of Girard, and Christopher Ryan Fox, 21, of Youngstown, died at the scene of the crash, according to the OSHP.

The driver of the box truck, Zachary Thomas Carpenter, 28, of Brookfield, was taken to Akron General Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

The operator of the disabled semi-tractor was not injured.I-71 was closed for about two hours because of the crash, the release said.
