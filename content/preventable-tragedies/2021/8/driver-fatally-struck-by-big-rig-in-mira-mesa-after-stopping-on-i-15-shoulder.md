MIRA MESA â€” A 41-year-old man was struck by a big rig and killed Sunday after getting out of his stopped car on a freeway shoulder in Mira Mesa, authorities said.

It happened about 3:35 p.m. Sunday on the right shoulder of north Interstate 15 approaching Mira Mesa Boulevard, California Highway Patrol Officer Salvador Castro said in a Monday news release.

As the driver exited his Mercedes-Benz sedan, a Volvo semi pulling a trailer in the far-right lane was unable to avoid the man and struck him, Castro said. The victim, whose name was not released, died at the scene.

The trucker remained at the crash site and cooperated with Highway Patrol investigators, Castro said. The crash remained under investigation Monday.
