title: "Long Beach man killed while trying to cross 91 Freeway in Anaheim Hills"
---
After his vehicle possibly broke down, a 26-year-old Long Beach man tried crossing the westbound 91 Freeway in Anaheim Hills but was killed when struck by multiple vehicles Thursday night, Aug. 19, authorities said.

The man had pulled over to the median just west of the 241 toll road, perhaps after his vehicle began experiencing problems, said Officer Florentino Olivera, a California Highway Patrol officer and spokesman.

Two passengers had successfully crossed the lanes to the shoulder.

The initial vehicle who hit the man did not stop to provide aid and officers were searching for the driver, Olivera said. That vehicle may have moderate, or major, front-end damage.The deceased man was not identified by CHP officers, pending notification of his relatives.
