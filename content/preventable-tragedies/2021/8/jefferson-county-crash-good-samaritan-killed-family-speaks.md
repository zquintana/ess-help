A young man has tragically died after being struck by a car while helping a ride-share driver change a tyre on the side of the road. 

The 21-year-old had been a passenger in a white Mitsubishi Outlander when it pulled over on the side of the Mitchell Freeway in Perth around 5am on Sunday.

The Good Samaritan had just finished changing the tyre and was packing up the equipment when he was hit by an oncoming Toyota Prado. It is unclear whether the 32-year-old driver of the Toyota Prado spotted the ride-share driver and his passenger before the collision, 7NEWS reported. Emergency crews rushed the young man to Royal Perth Hospital where he remained in a critical condition before tragically passing away overnight.Neither the ride-share driver or the owner of the Toyota Prado were injured.  

Investigations into the crash are continuing with WA Police asking any drivers with dashcam footage of the incident to submit it to authorities.
