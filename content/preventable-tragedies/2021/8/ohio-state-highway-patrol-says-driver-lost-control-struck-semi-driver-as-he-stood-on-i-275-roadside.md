Police have identified a semi-driver struck and killed by an out-of-control SUV Saturday on I-275 near Winton Road in Forest Park.

Robert Crouch, 30, of Morgantown, West Virginia, was struck on the highway's shoulder as he was standing on the roadside outside of the disabled semi, according to an Ohio State Highway Patrol release. He died at the crash scene, police said in the release.

Police said the crash, which happened shortly after 5 p.m. Saturday, involved three vehicles. The crash shut down the highway for hours.

The driver of a 2004 Chevrolet Trailblazer was initially trying to avoid another vehicle, police said. The Trailblazer lost control after striking the other vehicle and left the roadway to the right.

Police said the Trailblazer struck Crouch after it left the roadway.

The crash remains under investigation by OHSP.

Agencies that responded to the crash and assisted OHSP included the City of Forest Park Police Department, Colerain Township Police Department, City of Springdale Police Department, Springdale Township and Springfield City EMS and Fire Department and Ohio Department of Transportation.
