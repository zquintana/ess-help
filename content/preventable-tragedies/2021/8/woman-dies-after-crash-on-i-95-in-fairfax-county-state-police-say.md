A Fairfax County woman was fatally injured on Interstate 95 in a head-on crash in the Springfield area, the Virginia State Police said.

Stephanie D. Garcia, 29, of Reston, Va., died Sunday at a hospital after the crash Saturday at the Old Keene Mill Road exit, police said.

She was driving south in the express lanes about 7 a.m. when her car ran off the left side of the road, turned around on the shoulder and then reentered the express lanes facing the wrong way, state police said, citing witness accounts.

Her car collided head-on with a southbound car, then spun around and struck a concrete barrier, they said. She was not wearing a seat belt and was thrown from her vehicle, according to police.

The driver of the other car was taken to a hospital with serious injuries, police said. They said in a statement issued Monday that the crash remained under investigation.
