Salado, TX -- August 25, 2021, one person was fatally injured in a rear-end crash with a tractor-trailer on the shoulder of I-35 in Salado.

Authorities say the incident happened before 4:15 p.m. on southbound I-35 near mile marker 283. Preliminary investigation suggests only that a Ford F-150 collided with the back of a commercial semi-truck's trailer in the outside emergency lane of the roadway. The impact caused the pickup's front end to become wedged beneath the trailer.

Emergency crews extricated the pinned Ford driver and attempted treatment at the scene but the driver succumbed to his injuries. No other injuries were reported.

No further information is currently available.
