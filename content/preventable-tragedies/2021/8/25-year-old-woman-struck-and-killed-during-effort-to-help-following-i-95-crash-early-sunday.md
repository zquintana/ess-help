title: "25-year-old woman struck and killed during effort to help following I-95 crash early Sunday"
---
A 25-year-old woman was struck and killed early Sunday as she tried to help a man who had recently crashed while heading south on I-95, near the Delaware Avenue exit in Wilmington, according to Delaware State Police.  

The initial crash happened shortly after 4 a.m. when the man was driving in the single south lane and hit a metal crash cushion between the lane and the Delaware Avenue exit, police said. Then, the car rotated clockwise and subsequently blocked the entire south lane. 

After the crash, the woman, who was driving south, stopped her car on the left shoulder of the Delaware Avenue off-ramp and walked into the lane to try to help the man. 

Shortly after, a pickup truck, which was approaching the collision, struck the woman and the passenger side of the crashed vehicle, police said. Police said the driver could not see the crash because of weather conditions and lighting. The woman was taken to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead. Her identification is awaiting the notification of the next of kin. 

The man was also taken to a nearby hospital where he was treated and released for minor injuries. 

The south lanes of I-95 were closed at Route 202 for about five hours while the two collisions were investigated, police said. 

No further details were immediately available.
