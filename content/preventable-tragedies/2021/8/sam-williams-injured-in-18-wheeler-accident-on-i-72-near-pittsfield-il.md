Pittsfield, IL -- August 19, 2021, 36-year-old Sam Williams was injured when a tractor-trailer crashed into a construction zone on Interstate 72 near Pittsfield.

Authorities say the incident happened around 7:30 a.m. in a work zone on I-72 east of town. Preliminary investigation suggests 56-year-old Kyle Dietz was traveling through the construction area when he veered into the closed right lane of the roadway and struck a parked pickup truck with its hazard lights on. The truck also hit Williams, a worker on the crew, before crashing into a concrete barrier.

Both Williams and Dietz received minor injuries and declined medical treatment at the scene. Dietz was cited for failing to yield right of way to a construction vehicle, improper lane use, and driving too fast for conditions.

No further information is currently available.
