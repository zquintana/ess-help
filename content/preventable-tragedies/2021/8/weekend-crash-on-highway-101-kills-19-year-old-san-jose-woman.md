A 19-year-old woman died in a weekend crash on Highway 101 after the vehicle she drove hit a center retaining wall and then was struck by two other vehicles as it went back across the highway, the California Highway Patrol said.

The crash happened at about 3:10 a.m. Sunday in the southbound lanes, south of Fair Oaks Avenue, according to a statement from CHP spokesman Officer Ross Lee.

Authorities identified the woman as Briana Jones, of San Jose.

According to the CHP, Jones drove a 1998 Honda Civic that hit the center median while going south, resulting in a flat rear tire. As Jones tried to drive the car to the right shoulder of the highway, a 2020 Honda Civic and 2018 Subaru WRX hit her car, the CHP said.Jones died at the scene.

The drivers of the two other cars went by ambulance to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center after complaining of pain, but the CHP said they were expected to be OK.

The CHP said they do not believe Jones was impaired at the time she hit the median.

Traffic on Highway 101 was diverted onto Fair Oaks Avenue and was closed for about 2 1/2 hours, according to the CHP.
