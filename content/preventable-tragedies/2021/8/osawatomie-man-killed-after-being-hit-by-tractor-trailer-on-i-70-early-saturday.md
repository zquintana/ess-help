KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€”
An Osawatomie, Kansas, man was killed early Saturday when he was hit by a tractor-trailer after getting out of his car to inspect a blown tire, Kansas City police said.

Authorities said the crash was reported at 3:27 a.m. on Interstate 70 under Pittman Road.

Accident investigators said the driver of a Chrysler sedan had been heading west when apparently the vehicle's tire blew out. Police said the 28-year-old driver stopped the car and got out.

Police said a tractor trailer was heading west in the outside lane and the driver swerved to miss the car, but hit the driver of the Chrysler who was standing nearby.

The tractor trailer then ran off the road and overturned.

Police said the Osawatomie man died at the scene.

The truck driver was not hurt, but a passenger in the truck went to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

I-70 was closed at Blue Ridge Boulevard for the investigation and cargo cleanup.
