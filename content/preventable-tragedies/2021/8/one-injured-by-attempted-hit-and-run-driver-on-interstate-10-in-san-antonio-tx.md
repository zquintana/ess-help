title: "One Injured by Attempted Hit-and-Run Driver on Interstate 10 in San Antonio, TX"
---
San Antonio, TX -- August 29, 2021, one person was seriously injured in an attempted hit-and-run on Interstate 10 in San Antonio.

Authorities say the incident happened just after midnight in the 4900 block of I-10 East near Southeast Loop 410. Preliminary investigation suggests the victim pulled his Chevrolet Equinox onto the highway's shoulder when his vehicle's "low tire pressure" light activated. After he pulled onto the shoulder the driver was about to exit to check his tires when an eastbound Ford Explorer hit the Chevy, ripping off its driver's side door and injuring the victim.

The Ford continued onward a short distance to the Ackerman Road overpass and then the driver and passenger fled on foot. Police later arrested both and the driver was charged with intoxication assault, while the passenger was charged with public intoxication.

No further information is currently available.
