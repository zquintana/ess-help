MARTIN COUNTY â€” A 33-year-old Miami woman was killed early Sunday morning on Florida's Turnpike when she was struck while sitting in her disabled vehicle, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. 

The fatal wreck happened about 2:15 a.m. Sunday in the northbound lanes of mile marker 137, just south of the St. Lucie County line, FHP said. 

The woman had been in a separate crash earlier and had been sitting in her sedan in the left-hand lane of the turnpike, FHP said. Two northbound sedans crashed into her car, according to the report. 

The first moving car rear-ended the Miami woman's car, forcing it into the concrete median. As it spun around, the second car struck the driver's side, FHP said.

Troopers pronounced the woman dead at the scene.

An 18-year-old Port St. Lucie man who was a passenger in the second car suffered serious injuries, troopers said. His condition was not available. The other drivers, a 24-year-old St. Lucie County man and a 38-year-old Port St Lucie woman, were not seriously hurt.

The crash remains under investigation. Troopers did not release names of the people involved in the accident.
