JACKSONVILLE, Fla. â€” All lanes of I-95 near CR-210 are now open after a crash involving serious injuries Tuesday morning.

Florida Highway Patrol says four people were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Four vehicles were involved.

Their preliminary information shows a vehicle was disabled or had crashed going south on I-95 and a Good Samaritan stopped to help. That person was then hit by a second crash.That second crash may have been drivers taking evasive action or colliding into each other.

The Good Samaritan has the most serious injuries and is one of the two people who was flown to the hospital rather than driven.

FHP Sgt. Dylan Bryan says if you want to help someone on the side of the road, make sure you're in safe spot, your vehicle is out of the roadway, and be very cautious.
