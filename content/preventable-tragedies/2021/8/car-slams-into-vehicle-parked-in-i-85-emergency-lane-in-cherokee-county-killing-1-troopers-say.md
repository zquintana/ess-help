CHEROKEE COUNTY, S.C. â€”
South Carolina Highway Patrol troopers reported Wednesday a death as a result of a car crashing into another car parked on the side of an Upstate interstate.

The collision was reported Sunday at just after 5 a.m. in the northbound lanes of I-85 near mile marker 101 in Cherokee County, Trooper Gary Miller said. That's one mile south of Blacksburg.

Miller said a woman from Lilburn, Georgia, was driving a 2020 Nissan sedan when she went off the right side of the road and hit a disabled and unoccupied vehicle parked on the shoulder in the emergency lane.

A front seat passenger in the woman's car was injured and taken to Spartanburg Regional Medical Center where she died on Monday, Miller said.

He said the driver was not injured, and both the driver and her passenger were wearing seat belts.
