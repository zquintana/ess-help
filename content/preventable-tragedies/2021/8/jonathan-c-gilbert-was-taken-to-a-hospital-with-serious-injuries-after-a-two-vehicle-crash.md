State police say 26-year-old Raleigh resident Jonathan C. Gilbert was taken to a hospital with serious injuries after a two-vehicle crash on Route 1 in White County last night. Police say Gilbert stopped at a construction stop light, activated his hazard lights, and exited his truck due to vehicle issues. As he was walking around the vehicle, 45-year-old Carmi resident Bill W. Van struck its rear.
