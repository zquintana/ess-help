She was in a vehicle that stopped on the left lane shoulder at mile marker 109.8, according to troopers. Police said she and her passenger crossed the highway to the Somerset deceleration ramp and then went across the traffic lanes again to return to their vehicle.

She was hit and killed by a vehicle traveling in the left lane, police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene by Coroner Wally Miller.
