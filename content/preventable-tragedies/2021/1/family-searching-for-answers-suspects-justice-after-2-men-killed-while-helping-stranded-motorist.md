MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A family is searching for answers, suspects, and justice after two good Samaritans were killed after helping a stranded motorist.

On December 26, 42-year-old Duwarn Glover and 50-year-old Willie Sanders stopped near the intersection of Redbud Road and West Mitchell Road to help a driver whose car had broken down.

“They saw him stopped in the middle of the street, and they got out to help him. They actually got him up and running and were going back to their car,” Letitia Frieson, a cousin of Duwarn Glover told FOX13.That’s when a car hit both men knocking them into the turning lane. Memphis Police say when they tried to stand up with their injuries, they were hit a second time by another car.

“The second car was the end that killed both of them, but it was other vehicles that ran over them after that,” Frieson said. “We had a Ring video sent to us where there were just cars running over them. How do you just keep running over something when you’ve possibly been in the area and know there’s not a speedbump there?”
