Coroner IDs victim as Joseph Bertinoia, city of residence unknown, who was resolving a mechanical problem on his vehicle while parked Friday morning on Hartley at Robinson roads just off Interstate 505 and north of Midway Road

California Highway Patrol investigators seek the public’s help to identify the driver of a vehicle that struck and killed a 32-year-old man early Friday morning in rural north Vacaville.

The Solano County Coroner identified the victim as Joseph Bertinoia, city of residence unknown, who died prior to 6:55 a.m. while he was trying to resolve an apparent mechanical problem on his disabled Volkwagen sedan on Hartley at Robinson roads, just west of Interstate 505 and north of Midway Road.

In a press release, Officer Dave Harvey, public information officer for CHP-Solano, said evidence at the scene indicates that, after Bertinoia exited his vehicle, an unknown vehicle traveling northbound on Hartley collided with the victim, causing fatal injuries. The suspect vehicle fled the scene in an unknown direction, Harvey added.

Google maps photos show that shoulder space on Hartley Road is limited to bike lanes no wider than a few feet, and information from weather websites indicate the collision occurred before sunrise.Harvey said the investigation continues and officers seek the public’s help in identifying the suspect vehicle and its driver.
