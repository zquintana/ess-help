DAYTON, Ohio (WDTN) â€“ One person is dead and several more are injured after a car hit two cars that were stopped on the side of the road. 

A total of four cars were involved. It happened Sunday afternoon in the southbound lanes of I-75 near the Benchwood Road exit. I-75 was shut down for more than two hours. 

A Camaro and SUV pulled over to help another vehicle that was stopped on the side of the road. Law enforcement says another vehicle then hit those vehicles. 

Emergency crews arrived moments later and had to remove the roof of the SUV to get two women out, but they were pronounced dead on the scene. 

Two other people were taken to the hospital and are now in stable condition. One person walked away without injuries. 

Butler Township Police, Vandalia fire and police, and the Ohio State Highway Patrol are on scene.
