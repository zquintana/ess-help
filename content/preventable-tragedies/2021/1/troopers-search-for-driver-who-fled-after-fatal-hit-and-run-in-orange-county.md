ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. â€“ A 55-year-old man died Friday after what authorities say was a fatal hit and run.

According to the Florida Highway Patrol, the crash happened near Hiawassee Road and Coral Cove Road just after 11:30 p.m.

Troopers said a Ford Fusion was driving south on Hiawassee Road while the man was attempting to cross.

The Sedan struck the man, leaving him in the southbound lanes, troopers said.

The Fusion left the scene before authorities arrived.

Following the crash, a Toyota Camry stopped and the driver used their hazard lights to shield the man from oncoming traffic.

While the vehicle was stopped, a PT Cruiser failed to stop and struck the Camry. The force of the crash caused the Camry to run over the man, who was still on the roadway.

Troopers said the man was taken to a hospital where he later died.

Investigators found parts belonging to the vehicle and believe it to be a 2007-2009 silver/grey Ford Fusion with heavy front end damage.On Saturday, troopers say they were contacted by the owner of a silver 2009 Ford Fusion. Troopers towed this vehicle after examining it. According to FHP, the vehicle has front end damage consistent with striking a pedestrian. Authorities will analyze the vehicle for DNA evidence.

Authorities said the driver of the car is cooperating with the investigation and have identified them as the driver of the vehicle.

The crash is still under investigation, troopers say charges are pending.
