A 29-year-old Rialto woman died after her car was struck while she was stopped along the shoulder of the 10 Freeway near Bloomington with a flat tire, the California Highway Patrol said.

Lorraine Elizarraraz was pronounced dead at the scene at 7:09 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 16, the San Bernardino County Coronerâ€™s Office reported.

At about 6:40 a.m., Elizarraraz was stopped on the right eastbound shoulder of the 10 Freeway, east of Cedar Avenue, in a 2013 black Honda Fit with a flat tire. The driver of a 2017 white Nissan Sentra, a Chino resident, was traveling the same direction at an unknown speed. For reasons still under investigation, the driver of the Nissan allowed the vehicle to veer to the right and it collided into the rear of the parked Honda, the CHP reported.

The driver of the Nissan was transported to a local hospital for major injuries, CHP said.
