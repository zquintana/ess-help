A man is in hospital in critical condition after two tractor-trailers collided on Highway 401 overnight.

The crash happened just after 1 a.m. Tuesday on the eastbound express lanes approaching Allen Road.

Police said one of trucks was parked on the right shoulder when it was struck by the other truck. The second truck then hit the barrier and struck a bridge post.

The driver of the second truck suffered life-threatening injuries.

The eastbound 401 express lanes are closed from Highway 400 to the Allen Road.
