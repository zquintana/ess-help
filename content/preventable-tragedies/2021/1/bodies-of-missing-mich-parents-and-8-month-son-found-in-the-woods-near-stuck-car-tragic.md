---
A Michigan family missing for nearly two weeks has been found dead, according to authorities.

In a statement to PEOPLE, the Ogemaw County Sheriff's Office confirms that the bodies of Michael Dougherty, 35, Amanda Pomeroy, 32, and their 8-month-old son Jacob Dougherty were found by officials on Saturday.

Their discovery came three days after the Michigan State Police issued an endangered missing advisory, according to ABC affiliate WJRT.

The Bay City family was last seen on Jan. 12 in the Standish-Sterling area after dropping their 9-year-old daughter off at a friend's house, the outlet previously reported.When the couple failed to answer their phones or social media days later, family members grew concerned and alerted the Bay City Department of Public Safety (BCDPS), which officially reported the couple missing on Jan 16, WJRT reported.

At the time, it was believed they were traveling with their infant son, but it was not confirmed, police reportedly noted in their advisory.Around 4:25 p.m. on Saturday, a snowmobiler spotted a stranded vehicle matching the description of the family's in a wooded area off Stoney Ridge Road in Rose Township in Ogemaw County, the Sheriff's Office tells PEOPLE.

Police say they located the family's bodies outside the vehicle, though it was unclear how far away from their car they were found.

The Sheriff's Office also notes that the family's car was "stuck on a large rock on the two-track roadway and was disabled."

Following the gruesome discovery, the missing persons case was closed by both BCDPS and the Michigan State Police as the Ogemaw County Sheriff's Office continued to investigate, M Live reported.

On Wednesday, the Sheriff's Office confirmed to PEOPLE that autopsies were complete, with preliminary results indicating that hypothermia and exposure to the winter elements were the family's preliminary causes of death.

A toxicology report and a final autopsy report are currently pending, according to officials. 

"Investigation of the incident indicate no foul play and that the deaths are the result of a tragic set of circumstances," the sheriff's office says, adding that funeral arrangements are in the works.In the wake of the incident, a GoFundMe page was set up to assist the couple's older daughter, Michelle.

"We are doing what we can to help this family as they have to plan a funeral for 3 of their family members," the page reads. "We hope to raise enough to cover the funeral costs so this family doesn't have to worry about that along with their grieving."

"Any remaining funds will go to... Michelle, Doug and Amanda's daughter, and for anything she may need," the page continues.
