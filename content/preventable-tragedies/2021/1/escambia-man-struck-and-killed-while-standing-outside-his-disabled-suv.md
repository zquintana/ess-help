An Escambia County man was struck and killed while standing behind his disabled vehicle.

The Florida Highway Highway Patrol said the 37-year old man was standing behind his disabled SUV on the Highway 90 Escambia River Bridge about 9 p.m. Thursday. A 22-year old Pace man traveling westbound on Highway 90 in a pickup truck did not see the stopped SUV and hit both the SUV and the man.

The manâ€™s pickup continued into the eastbound lanes and struck another pickup truck. The 48-year old driver  and his 14-year old passenger suffered minor injuries. Both were from Pace.

The 22-year old Pace man that struck the SUV suffered only minor injuries.

The FHP is continuing their investigation.
