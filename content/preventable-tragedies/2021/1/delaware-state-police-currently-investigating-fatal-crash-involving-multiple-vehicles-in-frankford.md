FRANKFORD, Del. — Delaware State Police say they are currently investigating a fatal crash involving multiple vehicles in Frankford.

Police say the crash happened early Monday morning at the intersection of DuPont Boulevard and Lazy Lagoon Road. We’re told just before 6:45 A.M., a 2018 Subaru CrossTrek, driven by a 68-year-old woman of Frankford, was traveling westbound on Lazy Lagoon Road approaching the intersection of DuPont Boulevard. For unknown reasons, the Subaru reportedly attempted to cross through the intersection while an unknown vehicle was traveling northbound on DuPont Boulevard passing by. Troopers say this resulted in the front of the Subaru striking the right side of the unknown vehicle.

According to police, the force of the impact caused the Subaru to rotate 180 degrees before coming to rest in the middle of the road. Police say the unknown vehicle fled the scene and continued traveling north on DuPont Boulevard.

After the collision, a 2011 Lexus RX350 driven by a 61-year-old man of Selbyville approached the scene traveling northbound on DuPont Boulevard. Police say the car came to a complete stop in the road. The 61-year-old driver and a male passenger of Selbyville exited the Lexus to help the Subaru operator who was disabled in the roadway. Police then say a 2020 Acura RDX driven by a 61-year-old female of Berlin, MD, was approaching the scene traveling northbound on DuPont Boulevard. As the Acura reached the scene, we’re told the front of the car struck the rear of the Lexus. Police say the Lexus entered into the crossover between the northbound and southbound travel lanes, where it came to a final rest.

After the second collision, a 2002 Ford Explorer driven by a 67-year-old man of Ocean City, MD, approached the scene traveling northbound on DuPont Boulevard. Police ay when he reached the collision scene, the front of the truck hit the left side of the Acura that was also disabled in the roadway . As a result of the impact, the Lexus was forced into the left side of the Subaru, causing both vehicles to exit the northbound travel lanes and come to rest on the northbound shoulder of DuPont Boulevard. According to police, after the impact, the Ford entered the grass median and struck a roadway sign before coming to rest in the median.

Troopers say as the Subaru and Acura were traveling across the roadway, they collided with the driver of the Subaru and the occupants of the Lexus. They had all exited their vehicles and were in the roadway.

We’re told the driver of the Subaru sustained fatal injuries and was pronounced deceased at the scene. The identification of the driver is pending notification to next of kin. The driver of the Lexus was transported to an area hospital by ambulance and admitted in critical condition. The passenger of the Lexus, the driver of the Acura and the driver of the Ford were transported to an area hospital by ambulance with only minor injuries.
