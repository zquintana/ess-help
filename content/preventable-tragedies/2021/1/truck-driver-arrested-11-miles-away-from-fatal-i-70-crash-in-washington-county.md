A Virginia man is being held without bond after being accused of driving a tractor-trailer that fatally struck an Ohio man working on a disabled vehicle on Interstate 70 this week, according to state police.

Hosea Holcomb IV, 27, was arrested after the 7:30 a.m. Monday crash in Fallowfield Township, Washington County, police said.

Holcomb was driving east near mile marker 37 before the exit to the Mon-Fayette Expressway when the tractor-trailer veered off the highway onto the berm of the road, police said. The tractor-trailer hit John M. Isenberg III, 33, of Toronto, Ohio, who was standing next to his disabled vehicle.Isenberg died at the scene, according to the Washington County coroner.

Troopers said Holcomb continued driving eastbound 11 miles after hitting the man. He was arrested during a traffic stop near mile marker 48.2 in Westmoreland County just before the Smithton exit, police said.

Holcomb is charged with homicide by vehicle, accidents involving death, speeding and other summary traffic offenses. He is being held at the Washington County Jail. He did not have an attorney listed in online court records.

A preliminary hearing is set for Jan. 21.

Two other pedestrians have been killed in similar crashes on highways around the area in recent weeks.

Brandon C. Peterson, 18, of Scottdale, was outside of a disabled pickup truck on Route 119 in East Huntingdon when he was fatally struck by a tractor-trailer on Dec. 22.

A woman was hit by a vehicle and killed on the Pennsylvania Turnpike at the Somerset deceleration ramp on Jan. 4 after getting out of the vehicle she was riding in and crossing the highway on foot. That vehicle fled the scene eastbound, police said.
