New Albany, MS (July 20, 2021) – A trucking accident in New Albany resulted in the death of an Alabama man on Monday, July 19. 

The fatal crash reportedly occurred on Interstate 22 near mile marker 71 early that morning at around 5:13 a.m. Reports from the Mississippi Highway Patrol revealed that a 2019 Nissan Kicks was sitting in a vehicle on the westbound side of the highway. It was at that time that the vehicle was struck by an oncoming 1999 International 18-wheeler operated by 56-year-old Lorenzo Burrell of Epes, Alabama. 

The impact caused the Nissan to be pushed onto the shoulder. The impact caused the semi-truck to leave the roadway where it overturned. Burrell sustained fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene, while the driver of the Nissan, 39-year-old Fits Cadet of Jonesboro, Georgia, was also injured. 

An ongoing accident is being managed by local law enforcement officials. Our thoughts are with the injured victim and his family in hopes of a full recovery. 

We would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Lorenzo Burrell at this time.
