WEST PALM BEACH â€” A 60-year-old Port St. Lucie woman died Tuesday in a rear-end crash that occurred after her vehicle broke down on Interstate 95 near West Palm Beach, the Florida Highway Patrol reported.

FHP did not disclose the name of the woman who died in the wreck, which took place shortly after 8:30 a.m. on northbound I-95 just north of the 45th Street exit.

Investigators say the woman's sedan broke down in the left lane and a pickup struck it from behind. The pickup driver told investigators he saw the disabled vehicle in the travel lane but could not stop in time to avoid the crash.In 2020, the agency stopped identifying crash victims in its news releases, citing a 2018 state constitutional amendment modeled after California's Marsy's Law. The amendment allows crime victims and their families to have their names withheld from public reports.

FHP also did not identify the pickup driver.

The crash remains under investigation, FHP said.
