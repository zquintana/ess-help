Jul. 23—MORGANTOWN — A man was taken to the hospital Thursday afternoon after getting hit by a vehicle on Interstate 79.

Monongalia County Sheriff's deputies were sent to the crash, which happened on southbound I-79 near the 155 mile marker, or Star City exit, at 1:33 p.m.

A kayak and luggage rack fell off the victim's car, causing him and another occupant to get out of the vehicle to get the items off the road, according to the sheriff's office. He was then struck by a 2017 Ford Focus.

The victim was taken to J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital by Mon EMS. His condition was not released Thursday in time for this report.

The wreck caused the closure of southbound I-79 until just before 3 p.m. Traffic was backed up for about 2 miles.

Granville Police Department and Granville Fire Department also responded to the scene.
