Colorado Springs, CO (July 23, 2021) – A motor vehicle accident reported on Tuesday evening in the Colorado Springs area left several people injured. At around 9:20 p.m., on July 20, emergency crews were requested on-site at a crash on Interstate 25.

Reports from authorities show that a car was traveling on the southbound side of Interstate 25 when it struck a deer on the stretch of road between Fillmore Street and Garden of the Gods Road. The driver of the vehicle pulled off to the shoulder of the roadway to assess the damage.

The occupants of the vehicle exited the car to check the damage. As they stood next to the vehicle, they were struck by a second southbound vehicle. Four people were rushed to area hospitals with critical injuries. At this time, the circumstances surrounding the accident are under investigation with the Colorado Springs Police Department.

Our thoughts are with the victims injured in this accident. We hope for their full recovery.
