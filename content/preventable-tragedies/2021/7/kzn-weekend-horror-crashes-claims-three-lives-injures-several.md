Durban: Three people were killed and several people injured in horror accidents on KZN roads this weekend.

In an accident on Saturday evening, one person was killed in a crash involving multiple vehicles on the N2 in the vicinity of Zinkwazi.

Paul Herbst, of IPSS Medical Rescue, said paramedics were met with “chaos on scene”.

“Reports from scene indicate that a vehicle had allegedly broken down and was being pushed to safety, when it was rear-ended. Following the rear-ending, vehicles allegedly crossed lanes into oncoming traffic, resulting in further collisions.“Advanced life support paramedics declared one person dead on scene whilst they worked to stabilise a further two patients.”

Herbst said all injured patients were transported to hospital.

Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed a case of culpable homicide is being investigated by Newark SAPS.

“It is alleged that on June 3 at 6.30pm, five vehicles were involved in a collision on the N2 opposite Makhindale farm. A 45-year-old driver was knocked by another vehicle while pushing his vehicle and he died on the scene. Two injured passengers who were in another vehicle sustained injuries and were taken to hospital for medical attention.”
