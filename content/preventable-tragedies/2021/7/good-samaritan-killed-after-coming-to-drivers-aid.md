---
A woman who tried to help the driver of a crashed car is dead after another car ploughed into her on the Monash Freeway.

A woman has died after being struck by a car on the Monash Freeway, after pulling over to assist a driver who had crashed into traffic lights.

Investigators have been told a car travelling east on Heatherton Road in Endeavour Hills, crashed into traffic lights before continuing on and coming to rest on the Monash Freeway about 3.15am.

The woman stopped her car and went to assist the driver when she was hit by another car travelling along the Monash Freeway.

Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Christopher Hayes said police are “still piecing together the exact circumstances” of the multiple vehicle collision.

“Police believe that a small vehicle crashed off the Heatherton road overpass onto the inbound lanes of the freeway,” Sen-Sgt Hayes said.

“Another vehicle on the freeway has stopped to assist this person.

“This woman was struck by a third vehicle.

“The driver of this good Samaritan vehicle is a 63-year-old woman from Langwarrin.

“The driver of the first vehicle who crashed off the Heatherton road overpass is a 35-year-old man from Noble Park.”

He was taken to hospital with minor injuries and is assisting police with inquiries.

The driver of the vehicle that struck the woman is a 28-year-old Traralgon man.

He remains uninjured and is also helping police explain what happened.
