They were in an SUV stopped on the shoulder that was hit by a second SUV. Two of the injured were out of the car securing a load when the accident happened.

PETERSBURG — Six people were hurt early Saturday morning when their vehicle was struck by a car as it was stopped on the side of Interstate 95 near its junction with Interstate 85.

The accident happened around 2:10 a.m. Saturday, said State Police Sgt. Dylan Davenport. Davenport said the GMC sports-utility vehicle was stopped on the southbound right shoulder and two of its occupants were tying down a load to the vehicle when it was hit by the driver of an Acura SUV.

Davenport said the impact of the crash spun the Acura around to face northbound in the right lane.

One of the people outside the car, a 35-year-old man, was taken to a local hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. A 17-year-old boy also was out of the car when it was struck. Davenport said he and the GMC's other occupants — a 35-year-old woman, a 17-year-old girl and two boys ages 7 and 4 — were taken to the same hospital with less severe injuries.

All of the victims are from Pennsylvania, Davenport said.

The driver of the Acura was identified as Shana L. Temple, 29, of Disputanta. She, was wearing a seat belt and was not hurt, but she has been charged with driving under the influence and failure to maintain control.
