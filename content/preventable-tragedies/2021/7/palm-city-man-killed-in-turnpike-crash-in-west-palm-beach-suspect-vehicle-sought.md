WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (CBS12) â€” A 63-year-old man from Palm City was killed Tuesday in a crash on the Florida Turnpike that blocked all lanes and had traffic backed up for hours, the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) said.

The crash, involving a landscaping truck, happened in the southbound lanes just before Exit 99 at 1:34 p.m.

The truck was disabled on the side of the road due to a flat tire, according to FHP. The man believed to be the driver was standing near the flat tire on the outside shoulder when he was hit by an unknown vehicle.

The man died at the scene; his passenger was asleep in the truck at the time and didn't see the accident take place.
