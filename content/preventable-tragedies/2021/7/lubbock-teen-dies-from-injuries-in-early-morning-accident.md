A Lubbock man was killed early Monday morning about a half mile north of New Deal on Interstate 27.

Mark Anthony Holmes, 18, died after injuries he sustained after being struck at around 1:40 a.m. by a 2020 International truck driven by Douglas Dewayne Rogers, 64, of Lubbock, according to a news release from the Texas Department of Public Safety.

Holmes' vehicle, a  2010 Dodge Ram 1500, was stopped on the shoulder of the roadway, with the left side tires on the fog line. His vehicle had a blowout on the right front tire, the release states.

Holmes was attempting to change the tire and walked around to the driver side to retrieve something from the vehicle when he was struck by the truck driven by Rogers as it passed.

Holmes was transported to University Medical Center in Lubbock and and later died as a result of the injuries sustained in the crash, the release states.

Preliminary investigation showed weather and road conditions were dry and clear at the time of the crash.

Rogers was wearing a seat belt and was not injured.
