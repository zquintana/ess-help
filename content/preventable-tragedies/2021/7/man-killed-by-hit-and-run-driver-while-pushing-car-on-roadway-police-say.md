A 54-year-old man was killed in a hit-and-run crash around 3:45 a.m. Wednesday on Artesia Boulevard at the 710 Freeway overpass, police said.

The man, Darnell Bluitt of Compton, was reportedly pushing a disabled Acura sedan from behind when a GMC truck struck him and the Acura, according to Brandon Fahey, a spokesperson for the  Long Beach Police Department.

Bluitt died at the scene, according to the LBPD, but another man who’d been helping push the car escaped uninjured.

A woman who’d been steering the Acura was transported to a local hospital for minor injuries, according to police.

The man behind the wheel of the GMC drove off, police said, but officers found the truck in a nearby neighborhood.

Police said they arrested the truck’s driver on suspicion of DUI, hit-and-run and vehicular manslaughter. His bail was set at $100,000. Authorities identified him as 57-year-old Patrick Mount of Long Beach.
