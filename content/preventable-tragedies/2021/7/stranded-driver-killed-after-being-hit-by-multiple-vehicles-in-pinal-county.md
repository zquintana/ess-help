PINAL COUNTY, AZ (3TV/CBS 5) -- A driver whose car broke down in San Tan valley was killed as officials say he ran into traffic and was hit by multiple vehicles.

The driver has been identified as 62-year-old Ulrick Fisher.

Pinal County Sheriff Office officials say it happened Saturday night around 9:30 p.m. Fisher's car broke down just north of the Arizona Speedway.

Authorities say another motorist, going in the other direction, saw the stranded driver on the other side of the road and pulled over to offer assistance. As the stranded driver ran across the road toward the good Samaritan, officials say a minivan hit him.

After the first impact, officials say several other vehicles also hit Fisher. He was declared dead at the scene. The driver of the minivan was taken to the hospital as a precaution.

Officials say many vehicles stayed at the scene. The investigation is ongoing.
