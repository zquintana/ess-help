It was reported that the pickup truck rolled over an unknown number of times.

Police say the driver was assisted from the pickup truck by bystanders. Police said the driver of the tractor trailer was unhurt and was reported to be out of the truck off the side of the highway when the crash occurred.

According to police, a third vehicle was reportedly struck by debris from the pickup and the driver of that vehicle sustained minor injuries.
