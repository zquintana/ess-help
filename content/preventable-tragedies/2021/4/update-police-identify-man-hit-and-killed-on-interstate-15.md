Police have identified the man hit and killed on Interstate 15 near Idaho Falls while trying to help a driver who slid off the road Tuesday morning.

Idaho State Police say in a news release that the crash happened shortly before 8 a.m. near milepost 117 when 85-year-old Glen Howard, of Idaho Falls, parked on the right shoulder. Howard then tried to cross both southbound lanes to help the other vehicle.

As Howard tried making his way to the car in the median, a Dodge Ram pickup truck driven by 71-year-old Stephen Blaser, of Blackfoot, hit and killed him.

The southbound lanes were blocked for about two hours.

ISP troopers continue to investigate.
