CHARLOTTE, NC — An investigation is underway in east Charlotte after a 69-year-old man was killed and two others left injured after a sedan crashed into a disabled minivan Saturday evening, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Monday.

The collision involving a 1997 Dodge Caravan and a 2006 Mercedes-Benz S500 occurred around 9 p.m. April 24 near the 1000 block of Eastway Drive, near East Sugar Creek Road.

Officers responded to the scene and located three injured pedestrians struck in the collision. One of the victims — identified as Adrian Perez, 69 — was pronounced dead at the scene, CMPD said. The two remaining pedestrians were transported to an area hospital for treatment for serious injuries."The preliminary investigation indicates the Dodge Caravan, which was being driven by Adrian Perez, had become disabled in the roadway," CMPD said. "Adrian Perez was joined by the two other pedestrians in an attempt to assist with the disabled van."

The Mercedes-Benz, which was driven by Antonio Rayvon Garriett, 51, was traveling north on Eastway Drive when it struck all three pedestrians as they stood behind the van before it struck the vehicle, police said.According to a police account, Garriett was not impaired and a preliminary investigation does not indicate speed was a contributing factor in the case. He was charged with driving while license revoked, failure to register a motor vehicle and no liability insurance, CMPD said.

CMPD said anyone who witnessed the crash or has information about this case is asked to call 704-432-2169, extension 4, or leave information anonymously with Crime Stoppers at 704-334-1600.
