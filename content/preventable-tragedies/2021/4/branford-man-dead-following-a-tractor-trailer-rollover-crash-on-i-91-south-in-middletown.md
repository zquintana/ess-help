MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (WTNH) â€” One person is dead following a crash on I-91 south in Middletown between Exit 19 and 20 Thursday.

State Police said, a Savanna GMC was parked in the acceleration lane of I-91 south, just south of Exit 20 in Middletown. No one was in the vehicle.

A tractor-trailer driven by Richard Vining, 69, of Branford had just gotten on I-91 south from the Exit 20 on-ramp around 12:30 p.m. and was traveling in the acceleration lane.

Police say, for some reason, the tractor-trailer hit the GMC. The tractor-trailer overturned and broke through the metal beam guide rail along the acceleration lane.

Vining died of his injuries. It was his 69th birthday.

This case remains under investigation.
