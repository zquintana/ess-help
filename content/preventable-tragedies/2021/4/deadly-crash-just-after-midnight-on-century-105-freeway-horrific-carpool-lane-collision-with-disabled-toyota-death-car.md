A motorist was killed Thursday when his Toyota crashed and stopped in a carpool lane on the Century (105) Freeway in the Willowbrook area and was hit by another vehicle.

The collision was reported about 12:55 a.m. on the westbound 105 Freeway west of Alameda Street, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Gerson Jimenez, 38, of Whittier died at the scene, according to the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.Jimenez was driving a 2005 Toyota that crashed and stopped in the carpool lane. A 2006 BMW then crashed into the stopped Toyota, fatally injuring Jimenez, according to the CHP, which reported that the BMW driver was taken to a hospital for treatment of minor injuries.

After colliding with the 2005 Toyota, the BMW hit a 2016 Toyota that was westbound in the No. 2 lane, resulting in minor injuries to the three occupants of that vehicle, according to the CHP, which reported that “unsafe speed” was a factor in the crash.
