STERLING â€” A motorist was struck by two passing vehicles and killed on Interstate 190 after getting out of his car to inspect a flat tire.

The fatality occurred about 9 p.m. Thursday on the northbound side.

The victim, a 29-year-old Orange man, had been driving a 2019 Subaru WRX on the southbound side of Interstate 190, according to state police.

It is believed that the vehicle went out of control and crossed the median to the northbound lanes. The vehicle was disabled with a flat tire, police said, citing a preliminary investigation.

The driver moved the Subaru into the northbound breakdown lane and exited the vehicle.

A short time later, while walking near the median strip, he was struck by two vehicles, police said.
