INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — A 30-year-old Grant man died in a three-vehicle crash on State Road 60 early Thursday, Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Yanko Reyes said.

State troopers were called just before 6:15 a.m. to 154th Avenue or Lloyd Road, roughly midway between Florida’s Turnpike and Interstate 95, according to a report of the crash.

The Brevard County man who was driving a white 2010 Ford Fusion was pronounced dead at the crash site off State Road 60 in a stretch of rural highway passing largely through citrus groves. State troopers reported the westbound Fusion was struck by two vehicles as it attempted a left turn across eastbound lanes toward 154th Avenue.

Officials said a 33-year-old Okeechobee man in a white 2009 Ford F-150 was seriously injured when his pickup struck the passenger side of the Fusion.

The car stopped in the eastbound lanes of State Road 60 and was hit a second time by a 70-year-old Lake Wales man in a bronze 2019 Chevy Impala, who had minor injuries, according to highway officials.

Names of those involved in the crash were not released.

State troopers are still investigating the crash, Reyes said.
