WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah — A person was discovered dead in a vehicle that was found in a ditch off the Bangerter Highway in West Valley.

“The vehicle went off the road down into a ditch and it appears like it has been there for a while, we don’t know how long,” Utah Highway Patrol spokesman Sgt. Cameron Roden said.

Roden said there was water in the ditch, but the vehicle was not submerged. The vehicle was found in the area of state Route 201 and Bangerter Highway.
