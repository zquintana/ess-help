Four young people are recovering after being struck by a car Thursday night in Brandywine Hundred. 

The youths were hurt when they and a man were pushing a disabled vehicle along Foulk Road near Marleton Road just before 9:15 p.m. 

A 2005 Nissan Maxima, operated by a 23-year-old Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, man became disabled in the right south lane of Foulk Road, according to Delaware State Police.

The Nissan did not have its flashers on.

The youths got out of their vehicle and began pushing the Nissan off the roadway. So did a 30-year-old Coatesville, Pennsylvania, man, who parked his BMW on Foulk Road, blocking the south lanes.

As they pushed the Nissan, a 2017 Kia Rio – also in the south lanes of Foulk Road – came up to the BMW.

The Kia's driver, a 65-year-old New Castle man, swerved to avoid hitting the BMW, but instead struck the Nissan, police said. 

The Kia continued traveling in a southwest direction, hitting four juveniles who were on the curb next to the Nissan, said Senior Cpl. Jason Hatchell, a police spokesman. 

"All four juveniles sustained minor injuries," Hatchell said. The teens were taken to Nemours Children's Hospital, Delaware.

No other injuries were reported. 

The Kia driver was cited for careless driving. The Nissan operator was cited for failure to have insurance and having a fictitious tag.

The operator of the BMW was cited for leaving a vehicle in the roadway.
