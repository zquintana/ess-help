LEON COUNTY, Fla. (WTXL) â€” A semi-truck driver was seriously injured Thursday morning after troopers say he fell asleep at the wheel and hit another semi-truck that was parked in the emergency lane.

A Florida Highway Patrol incident report said that around 7 a.m. near the 196 mile marker on I-10 eastbound, a semi-truck was in the right lane when the driver fell asleep and hit another semi-truck that was parked in the right-side emergency lane.

The semi-truck driver who fell asleep at the wheel was transported to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital with serious injuries and the driver of the semi-truck that was hit was unharmed in the crash.
