Berks County, PA -- December 17, 2021, one person in a box truck was killed in a rear-end collision with a parked tractor-trailer along Interstate 78 in Berks County.

Authorities say the incident happened around 6:00 a.m. on I-78 at mile marker 29.3 and the Route 61 on-ramp in Tilden Township. Preliminary investigation suggests a commercial 18-wheeler was parked on the on-ramp from southbound PA-61 to westbound I-78 and had its 4-way hazard lights activated. An Enterprise box truck, traveling along I-78, reportedly approached the big rig from behind and crashed into its trailer for unknown reasons.

A passenger in the Enterprise truck died at the scene. The truck's driver received moderate injuries and was transported to an area hospital. The semi-truck driver was unhurt.

No further information is currently available.
