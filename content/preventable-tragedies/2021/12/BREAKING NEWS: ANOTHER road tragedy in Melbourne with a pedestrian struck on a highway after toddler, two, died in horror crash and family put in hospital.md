A woman has been hit and killed by a truck after she stopped her car on the side of a busy Melbourne freeway.

She had pulled over to the side of the Monash Freeway opposite Darling Station at about 8.10 on Friday morning and stepped out of her car.

She was then tragically hit by a passing truck and died at the scene.
