A 73-year-old female pedestrian was struck by a pickup truck at around 4:40 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 1, 4 miles north of Killdeer on Highway 22. According to the 

North Dakota Highway Patrol, the pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene.

Warren Jensen, 58, of Berthold, was the driver of a 2017 Chevy Silverado traveling northbound on Highway 22 from Killdeer to Berthold and approached a motorist 

stopped on the northbound shoulder changing a flat tire. The Killdeer woman, whose name has not been released until next of kin can be notified, parked her vehicle 

on the southbound shoulder to assist the motorist in changing their tire. As she started to cross the highway, Jensen struck the female pedestrian who came to rest 

in the northbound lane.

According to the North Dakota Highway Patrol, Jensen was wearing his seatbelt when the incident occurred and suffered no injuries during the collision. Following 

the incident, Jensen pulled his vehicle over to the shoulder.

The press release also indicated that road conditions were dry, with reduced visibility as it was dark, cloudy and past sunset.

The case remains under investigation by the North Dakota Highway Patrol. The Dunn County Sheriffâ€™s Office, West Dunn Fire District and Killdeer Area Ambulance were 

also dispatched to the scene.
