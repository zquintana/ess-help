title: "Kenneth Olson Dies after 18-Wheeler Hits Disabled Car on I-35E in Lewisville, TX"
---
Lewisville, TX -- December 30, 2021, 81-year-old Kenneth Olson was killed when a commercial tractor-trailer struck his disabled vehicle on Interstate 35E in Lewisville.

Authorities say the incident happened around 1:45 a.m. along southbound I-35E. Preliminary investigation suggests Olson stopped his vehicle in one of the highway's travel lanes. Shortly after that an 18-wheeler approached from behind and crashed into the stopped vehicle, pushing it hundreds of feet further down the road before coming to a stop. The collision ruptured one of the big rig's fuel tanks, causing diesel fuel to spill onto the roadway.

Police at the scene spoke briefly to Olson before he was transported to an area hospital for evaluation. He reportedly died a short time later. The truck driver reportedly received minor injuries.

The circumstances of the crash, including why Olson's vehicle became disabled, remain under investigation.

No further information is currently available.
