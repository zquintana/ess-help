Alexandria, MN -- December 20, 2021, 23-year-olds Jacob Carlson and Alexander Sagendorf were injured by a semi-truck on the shoulder on Interstate 94 near Alexandria.

Authorities say the incident happened around 2:30 p.m. on westbound I-94. Preliminary investigation suggests Carlson and Sagendorf stopped their pickup truck on the westbound shoulder to change a tire on a trailer they were towing. As the two worked to change the driver's-side tire, they were reportedly struck by a passing Peterbilt semi-truck.

Both men suffered injuries described as "non-life-threatening" and were transported to a Fergus Falls hospital. The truck driver was unhurt.

No further information is currently available.
