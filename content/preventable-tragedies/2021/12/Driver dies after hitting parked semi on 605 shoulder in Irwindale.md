title: "Driver dies after hitting parked semi on 605 shoulder in Irwindale"
---
A man died Sunday when his minivan hit a semi truck parked on the shoulder of the 605 Freeway in Irwindale, authorities said.

The coroner’s office has not yet released the man’s name because his family still needs to be notified. Officer Rodrigo Jimenez, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol, described the driver as a 46-year-old Mira Loma man.

The fatal collision happened on the freeway, north of Live Oak Avenue, at 9:53 p.m..

The man was driving a Toyota Sienna south on the 605 Freeway when the minivan drifted to the right and into the freeway shoulder where it crashed into a parked semi truck, Jimenez said.

He said the man died at the scene while the truck driver, a 54-year-old Las Vegas man, wasn’t injured.

The CHP doesn’t know yet why the Sienna’s driver drifted off the roadway.
