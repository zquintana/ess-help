TALLADEGA, AL, (November 28, 2021) - A Riverside woman was fatally struck by a vehicle as she stood next to her disabled car, which was involved in a prior accident early Sunday, Talladega police said.

Taniiya Cook, 26, was initially taken to the emergency room at Citizens Baptist Medical Center in Talladega and then rushed to the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital. Sadly, she died from her injuries.

Through investigation, police determined Cook was traveling in a car involved in a crash, causing her vehicle to become disabled on Alabama 77 near Valley Road at about 2 a.m. Reports say that Cook was outside her car when another motorist struck her.

Alabama State Troopers have taken up the investigation process, and a final report will be released soon.
