This is an updated story in development.

Traffic was cut off after multiple vehicles collided at the William B. Sands Bridge (commonly known as the 22nd Avenue elevated road), followed by 39 vehicles colliding in a chain reaction.

Decatur fire brigade commander Neil Elder said an ambulance took four or five people off the scene, but the injuries were minor.

Vehicles can be seen on the elevated 22nd Avenue after the collision on Monday morning.

I told Herald & Review just before 8am. “There were no major injuries. There were more humps, bruises and back pain. There were no serious injuries.”

The crash occurred before 7am on Monday. Among the vehicles stuck in the north lane were several damaged vehicles. One vehicle was in the southbound lane. Before 8 am, there were several tow trucks and ambulances, police and fire brigades on the scene.

The elder also said that he had crashed at US36 Bridge and Gunbashi on Monday morning. “The heavy frost this morning clearly caused danger,” he said, urging the driver to pay attention.
