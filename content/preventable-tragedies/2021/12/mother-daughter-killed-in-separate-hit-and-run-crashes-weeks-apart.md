title: "Mother, Daughter Killed In Separate Hit-And-Run Crashes Weeks Apart"
---
An Atlanta-area family is mourning after experiencing the unfathomable loss of their mother and sister who died in separate hit and run accidents just weeks apart.

"It doesn't add up, because why would you just leave and not even check to see what was going on," sister Adrienne Gaither told WSB-TV.

DeKalb County police say Adrienne's sister, Jasmine Gaither was a passenger in a car involved in a four-car accident along Atlanta's busy I-85 highway Friday night (December 3). As Jasmine and others involved stood by waiting for police to arrive, another driver switched lanes, lost control of the vehicle and slammed into the car Jasmine had been standing next to, before speeding off.

The 31-year-old was transported to a nearby hospital where she died.

On Tuesday (December 7), police arrested a suspected, Lester C. Rodriguez, charging him with first-degree homicide by vehicle, reckless driving, hit-and-run, and driving on a suspended license.

Jasmine's death comes just weeks after the family lost their mother, Tomeka Ivey, to a separate hit-and-run accident a month before Thanksgiving.

"We never could've thought something like this could happen," Jasmine's other sister, Brittany Flournoy told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

"The three head women of our immediate family: my mom, my grandma, and my older sister... they're gone," Flournoy said in an interview with 11 Alive.

Jasmine's family said the soon-to-be 32-year-old was artistic, enjoyed photography and had made plans to bring in her birthday with family.

"Now she's gone and we just don't know how we're going to make it through," Flournoy said.

The family has set up a fundraiser to help cover funeral expenses. To donate, please click here.
