A 27-year-old man died and three other people were injured when a pickup rear-ended a stalled sedan Saturday morning on State Highway 360 in Arlington.

Arlington police were dispatched just before 8 a.m. to the 2300 block of South State Highway 360, near East Sublett Road, where a southbound Toyota Tacoma had crashed into a stalled BMW sedan.

A 27-year-old passenger in the BMW was thrown from the vehicle. The man, identified by the Tarrant County medical examiner’s office as Arlington resident Tomi Davis, was taken to a hospital and died a short time later.

The driver of the BMW was seriously injured in the crash and taken to a hospital. Another passenger in the car and the driver of the truck were treated for minor injuries by first responders.

No charges are expected to be filed against the pickup’s driver, police said.
