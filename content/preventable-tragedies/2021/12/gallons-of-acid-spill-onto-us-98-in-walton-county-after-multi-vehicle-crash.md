title: "Gallons of acid spill onto U.S. 98 in Walton County after multi-vehicle crash"

A multi-vehicle crash involving a truck carrying four gallons of muriatic acid caused both lanes of U.S. Highway 98 to be shut down for several hours Thursday night.

The crash happened around 5:09 p.m. on U.S. Highway 98 near County Road 283 in Walton County, according to a report by the Florida Highway Patrol.

A sedan and a pickup truck were stopped in the inside eastbound lane of U.S. Highway 98 when another vehicle driven by a 35-year-old man from Niceville failed to slow down and crashed into the truck.

The collision caused the pickup truck to hit the rear end of the sedan, the FHP reported. The driver of the sedan, a 43-year-old woman from Santa Rosa Beach, sustained minor injuries from the crash.

The truck was carrying around four gallons of muriatic acid, a solution commonly used for cleaning and preparing concrete or lowering the pH in pools. Momentary skin exposure can cause severe burns.

The muriatic acid spilled onto the roadway during the crash, causing a chemical cloud to form across both the east and west lanes on U.S. Highway 98, according to the FHP.

Deputies with the Walton County Sheriff's Office redirected traffic while the South Walton Fire District and Walton County Emergency Management cleared the hazardous material from the roadway. All lanes of travel were reopened by around 9:25 p.m.
