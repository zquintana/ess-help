A 62-year-old man from Sebastian has died after he lost control of his pickup truck on State Road 52 and collided with a flatbed trailer parked on the side of the road, according to a Florida Highway Patrol news release.

The man was driving on State Road 52, east of Shady Hills Road, when he got into a left turn lane and tried to pass other vehicles, the release said. He lost control of his truck, which traveled south and passed through the eastbound lanes of the road.

The manâ€™s vehicle struck the flatbed trailer of an unoccupied semitrailer that was parked on the side of the road in a construction zone. The man was thrown from his vehicle and died at the scene, troopers said.
