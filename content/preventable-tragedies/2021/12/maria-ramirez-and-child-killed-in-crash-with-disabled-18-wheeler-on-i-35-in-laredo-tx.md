Laredo, TX -- December 18, 2021, 27-year-old Maria Matiana Ramirez and a young boy were killed in a collision with a disabled tractor-trailer on Interstate 35 in Laredo.

Authorities say the incident happened around 3:00 p.m. on southbound I-35 near mile marker 20. Preliminary investigation suggests a commercial 18-wheeler was disabled on the shoulder of the roadway in a heavy rainstorm. The victims, reportedly in a Dodge pickup truck, lost control on the roadway and collided with the back of the parked big rig.

Ramirez and the four-year-old boy, both passengers in the pickup, suffered fatal injuries in the crash. The condition of the truck's other occupants is unknown. The semi-truck driver was unhurt.

No further information is currently available.
