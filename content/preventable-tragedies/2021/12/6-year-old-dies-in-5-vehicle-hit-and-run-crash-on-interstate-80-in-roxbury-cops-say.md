A 6-year-old boy died following a five-vehicle crash in Roxbury on Thursday night involving a hit-and-run driver who is now being sought, the New Jersey State Police said.

Authorities said a preliminary investigation revealed that at about 7:45 p.m. on Thursday a 2012 Chevrolet Equinox heading east on Interstate 80 was struck near milepost 28.5 by “an unknown vehicle that fled the scene.”

The Chevrolet Equinox was then struck by a Honda HRV, which was hit by a Nissan Altima leading to the Chevrolet Equinox hitting a Honda Passport, which held the 6-year-old, police said in a statement.The identity of the boy, who police said sustained fatal injuries in the crash, was not disclosed.

It was unclear if anyone else was hurt in the crash. Officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The New Jersey State Police is asking anyone with information on the crash — including any witnesses or those with information on what led to it — to call Troop “B” Netcong Station at 973-347-1001. Callers can provide information anonymously.
