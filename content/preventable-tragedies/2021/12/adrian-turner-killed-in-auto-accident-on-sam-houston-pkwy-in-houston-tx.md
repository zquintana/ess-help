Houston, TX -- December 14, 2021, Adrian Turner was struck and killed by a vehicle while outside his car on Sam Houston 

Parkway in Houston.

Authorities say the incident happened around 4:30 a.m. in the area of 10798 North Sam Houston Parkway, between Wilson 

Road and John Ralston. Preliminary investigation suggests Turner was traveling east on the roadway in a Volkswagen 

Jetta when he may have lost control and hit a guardrail. He then stopped in a travel lane and activated the car's 

hazard lights, then exited the vehicle. Soon after a vehicle crashed into the Jetta while a second vehicle hit Turner himself.

Turner was pronounced dead at the scene.

Both drivers involved in the crash reportedly stayed at the scene and showed no signs of impairment.

No further information is currently available.
