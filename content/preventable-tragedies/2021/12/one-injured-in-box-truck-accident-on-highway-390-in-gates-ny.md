Gates, NY -- December 28, 2021, injuries were reported after a collision between a passenger vehicle and a box truck on southbound State Route 390 in Gates.

Authorities say the incident happened Tuesday on southbound 390 near the flyover ramp. Preliminary investigation suggests the passenger vehicle became disabled in 

the area for unknown reasons and was stopped partially blocking the left travel lane. A box truck in that lane then approached and crashed into the vehicle, pushing 

it approximately 50 yards before coming to rest.

The passenger vehicle's 50-year-old driver suffered non-life-threatening injuries in the collision. The box truck driver was unhurt and received unspecified 

citations from investigators.

No further information is currently available.
