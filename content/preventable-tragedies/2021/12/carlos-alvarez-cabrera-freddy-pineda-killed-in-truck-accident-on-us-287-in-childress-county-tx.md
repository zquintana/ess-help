Childress County, TX -- November 28, 2021, Carlos Alvarez-Cabrera and Freddy Pineda were killed by a tractor-trailer on the shoulder of U.S. Highway 287 near 

Childress.

Authorities say the incident happened around 11:30 a.m. on US-287, roughly six miles east of town. Preliminary investigation suggests Alvarez-Cabrera and Pineda 

were two of five occupants of a pickup truck that parked on the northbound shoulder of the highway for unknown reasons. Reports indicate four of the truck's five 

occupants exited the vehicle and were standing near it when a commercial semi-truck veered onto the shoulder and hit the pickup, as well as Alvarez-Cabrera and 

Pineda, before skidding into a ditch and overturning.

Alvarez-Cabrera and Pineda were pronounced dead at the scene. The pickup's three other occupants were uninjured. The truck driver, later identified as Christopher 

Tyson, was also unhurt.

No further information is currently available.
