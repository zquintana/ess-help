Ralls County, MO -- November 30, 2021, 55-year-old pedestrian Melvin Hisel was struck and killed by a tractor-trailer on State Highway 19 in Ralls County.

Authorities say the incident happened around 5:15 a.m. on northbound Route 19, roughly three miles south of Perry. Preliminary investigation suggests Hisel's car 

somehow became disabled in the travel lanes around a mile from where he was struck. He set out on foot but walked using a cane and fell down on the edge of the 

northbound lane. Another motorist pulled over and started to help him move off the highway, but a commercial 18-wheeler approached and hit Hisel before he could 

full stand up or get to safety.

Hisel was pronounced dead at the scene. The truck driver was unhurt.

No further information is currently available.
