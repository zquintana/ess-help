DUXBURY â€“ A multi-car crash in Duxbury on Sunday sent one person to the hospital with serious injures and the driver allegedly responsible for the chain-reaction crash is facing charges.

State Police spokesman Dave Procopio said in a press release that troopers responded to the northbound Route 3 crash at 10:21 p.m. Sunday.

The driver, a 28-year-old Scituate man, crashed into a guardrail on the left side of the road, leaving his car disabled in the left travel lane. Another car swerved to the right to avoid hitting the disabled car, setting off a chain reaction and wrecking three additional vehicles, Procopio said.

A 59-year-old Plymouth man who State Police did not name was taken to South Shore Hospital in Weymouth with "serious" injuries. The other two drivers involved in the crash, a 26-year-old Waltham man and a 24-year-old Weymouth man, were sent to regional hospitals with minor injuries.

After crashing into the guardrail, the Scituate man ran from the scene, police said.  Officers arrested him near Beaver Dam Road. He was taken to South Shore Hospital for minor injuries.

Police charged him with leaving the scene of a crash causing personal injury, negligent operation of a motor vehicle and speeding.

The crash shut down both lanes of Route 3 for four hours as police investigated the crash. The road was opened just before 2 a.m. Monday.
