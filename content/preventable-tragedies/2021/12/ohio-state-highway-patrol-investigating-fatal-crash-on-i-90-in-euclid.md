EUCLID, Ohio â€” The Ohio State Highway Patrol is investigating a fatal crash that occurred Monday night on I-90 eastbound in Euclid. 

Troopers say 65-year-old Peter M. Gaylor, of Athens, New York was driving a 2018 Mack tractor with trailer and was stopped in the right lane due to backed up traffic for a crash that was being handled by the Euclid Police Department.

George A. Lloyd III, 67, of Cleveland was driving a 2017 Dodge Caravan. Troopers say Lloyd struck the rear of the trailer that Gaylor was hauling. Lloyd was pronounced deceased at the scene.

Neither vehicles had any passengers. Troopers say alcohol or drugs are not believed to have played a role in the crash.
