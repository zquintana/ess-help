---
Gallatin County, MT -- December 26, 2021, Krysti Hoskins was killed and another person was injured following an accident where their vehicle hit a semi.

Investigators reported that the crash took place early Sunday off the intersection of I-90 and Jackrabbit Lane.

Authorities said that 27-year-old Krysti Hoskins was in a Toyota Rav4 merging onto westbound I-90 from Jackrabbit Lane. There were reportedly whiteout conditions at the time, and the driver of the Toyota did not see a stopped tractor-trailer ahead of them. Reports were not clear on where exactly the truck stopped. As a result, Hoskins's vehicle crashed into the back of the 18-wheeler.

Due to the severity of the collision, Hoskins succumbed to fatal injuries. The 31-year-old Whitefish man driving the Toyota went to a hospital with reportedly non-life-threatening injuries. At this time, no further information is available.
