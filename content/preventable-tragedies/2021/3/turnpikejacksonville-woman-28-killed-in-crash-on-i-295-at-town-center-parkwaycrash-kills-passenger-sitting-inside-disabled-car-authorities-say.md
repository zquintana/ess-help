JACKSONVILLE, Fla. â€” One person is dead following a crash early Monday morning on I-295 South in Jacksonville. Troopers said it happened near the Town Center Parkway exit.

According to the Florida Highway Patrol, at 3:45 a.m., a silver car was traveling southbound on I-295 when it hit a crash attenuator, on the right shoulder of the ramp.

FHP said the car became disabled, blocking the on-ramp from Town Center Parkway to southbound I-295. The driver, a 28-year-old Jacksonville woman, got out of the sedan and was standing on the passenger side of the car when FHP said a silver SUV hit her and her car.

Troopers said she died at the scene. The 58-year-old driver of the SUV was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. Their identities have not been released at this time.
