A 4-year-old girl died Tuesday after a multi-vehicle collision on Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass, an incident that officials said occurred after one motorist stopped to help another following a separate crash on the freeway.

At about 8 p.m. Tuesday, the unidentified driver of a 2016 Kia Sedan hit a 2014 Hyundai sedan at an unknown speed before colliding into the rear of a 2020 Ford Explorer in which the child had been riding, according to the California Highway Patrol.  

The collision occurred on the southbound side of the freeway, north of State Route 138. The force of the impact to the Ford resulted in serious bodily injury to the 4-year old, a resident of Modesto. Emergency personnel took her to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton, where she died several hours later, the CHP said.
