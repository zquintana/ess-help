LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Indiana State Police is investigating after a man was struck and killed by a semi-truck on I-65N in Scott County, Indiana, early Monday after he stepped out of his vehicle following a crash. 

According to a news release from ISP, 911 calls reporting the crash started coming in just before 3 a.m. about the accident near mile marker 34, not far from Austin. When officers from the Austin, Indiana Police Department and Indiana State Troopers arrived at the scene, they found the victim, 25-year-old Stefan Porch of Matteson, Illinois. He was pronounced dead at the scene after being hit by a northbound semi-truck.Before he was hit, investigators believe Porch was northbound in a silver 2020 Kia Forte with five passengers when he collided with a second vehicle, possibly the rear of a northbound tractor-trailer or box truck. According to the release, "it appears the second vehicle did not stop and continued from the scene."

Investigators say Porch stopped his car and got out, stepping into the path of a northbound semi-truck. Police say the semi's driver was unable to avoid striking Porch. The driver of the semi wasn't injured. 

Sgt. Carey Huls posted a tweet at 4:15 a.m. saying all northbound lanes were closed at mile marker 29. The lanes reopened by 8 a.m. The five passengers in the Kia were taken by ambulance to Scott Memorial hospital, but no significant injuries were reported.
