title: "Nearly three live lane breakdowns every day on M1 smart motorway in January"
---
There were nearly three breakdowns every day in live lanes on a 10-mile stretch of M1 smart motorway in January, "shocking" new figures reveal.

Live lane breakdowns occurred 81 times in January between Junction 32 and Junction 35A in South Yorkshire, according to Department for Transport statistics obtained by Rotherham MP Sarah Champion .

Since March 2017, when the section became a "smart motorway" with no hard shoulder, there have been an average of 68 incidents per month where vehicles have broken down in live lanes.

In March 2018 there were 108 live lane breakdowns in this stretch of the M1 - an average of more than three per day.

Labour MP Ms Champion called on the Government to abandon the "deadly roads"."“I was shocked and terrified by the sheer number of incidents in which vehicles stopped in live lanes on just this one small section of the smart motorway network," she said.

"Each of these incidents could have resulted in more lives lost on these dangerous roads.

"‘By removing the hard shoulder, vehicles becoming stranded in moving traffic is made immeasurably more likely."The Government says it’s committed to rolling out new technology and safety improvements, but all that these achieve is to marginally reduce the huge risks they’ve created by removing the vital refuge that the hard shoulder provides.

"It is high time the Government listened to campaigners, motoring organisations and bereaved families and abandoned these deadly roads.”

Responding to questions from Ms Champion in Parliament, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: "Smart motorways have been under development since 2001 under the Blair-John Prescott Government.

"I think I’m the first Secretary of State in 12 to carry out the stock take and review, and I won’t rest until these are as safe as possible.”

The new statistics come a week after YorkshireLive revealed the "terrifying" number of broken-down vehicles stranded in live lanes across Yorkshire's smart motorways last year.

News of the concerning figures come after two high-profile inquests into three deaths on the M1 involving drivers who had broken down in a live lane.

Sheffield grandmother Nargis Begum was killed in September 2018 when another vehicle collided with her Nissan Qashqai as she waited for help, causing the 62-year-old's car to plough into her.And in June 2019 Jason Mercer and Alexandru Mergeanu died when lorry driver Prezemyslaw Szuba crashed his lorry into their vehicles after they stopped in a live lane following a minor collision.

Three sections of Yorkshire smart motorways do not have hard shoulders and are known as "all lanes running" motorways. These are:

The M1 between Junction 32 and Junction 35a
The M1 between Junction 39 and Junction 42
The M62 between Junction 25 and Junction 26
Refuge areas on these roads are supposed to provide a safe area for broken-down vehicles to stop.
