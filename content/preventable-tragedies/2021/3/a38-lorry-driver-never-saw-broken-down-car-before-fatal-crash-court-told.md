title: "A38 lorry driver never saw broken-down car before fatal crash, court told"
---
A lorry driver who crashed into a car and killed a Plymouth mother on the A38 has told a jury he never saw the broken-down vehicle.

But Jack McIntyre, aged 36, said he did nothing wrong before the accident which left Briony Elliott dead.

His Scania articulated lorry struck a silver Audi A4 on the inside of the eastbound dual carriageway near the Leigham interchange â€“ where there is no hard shoulder.

The car was pushed into the 54-year-old on the road side of the crash barrier and she was fatally injured, Plymouth Crown Court heard.

McIntyre, working for Gregory Distribution, is on trial after he denied causing death by dangerous driving in the accident more than two years ago.

The defendant, of Victoria Road, St Budeaux, also denies the lesser alternative of causing death by careless driving on September 11, 2018.
