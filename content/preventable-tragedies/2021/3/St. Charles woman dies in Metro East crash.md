MADISON COUNTY â€” A woman from St. Charles died in a crash Thursday afternoon when her car stalled on the interstate and was hit by a tractor-trailer. 

The 34-year-old woman, not yet identified by police, was driving a 2016 Toyota on eastbound Interstate 70, at milepost 18 in Madison County, when her car stalled. The tractor-trailer did not slow down, police say, and hit her car just after 12:30 p.m. 

She was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the tractor trailer was not injured.
