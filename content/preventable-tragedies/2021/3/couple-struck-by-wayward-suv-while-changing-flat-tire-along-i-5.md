BELLINGHAM, Wash. -- Three people were injured when an SUV smashed into a truck and travel trailer that was undergoing a tire change along I-5 in Bellingham Sunday.

The trailer had suffered a flat tire in the northbound lanes near Samish Way and a man and woman were just about done replacing with a spare when an SUV changed lanes and veered into shoulder, striking the trailer, according to Trooper Rocky Oliphant.The trailer spun around and knocked both the man and woman into a nearby ditch with the woman taking more of a direct hit, Oliphant said. She suffered a severe concussion and cuts to her face but was expected to recover, Oliphant said. Both the man and the driver of the SUV were treated for minor injuries.Troopers are still investigating what exactly led up to the crash, but believe the SUV driver was not impaired.
