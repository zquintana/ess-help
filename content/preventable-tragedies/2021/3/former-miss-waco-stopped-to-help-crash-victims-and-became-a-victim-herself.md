WACO, Texas (KWTX) â€“ After nearly two months of treatment and therapy, things are looking up for former Miss Waco Jamie Blanek, who was critically injured on the night of Feb. 6 when she was struck after she stopped to help victims of a crash at Chapel Road and Old Lorena Road west of Hewitt where a Jeep had collided with a Chevrolet Sonic whose driver failed to yield the right of way, according to Department of Public Safety reports.

Blanek was in front of the Jeep when a Buick sedan collided with the rear of the vehicle.

The Jeep, propelled by the impact of the collision, slammed into her.

She was flown to Scott & White Medical Center in Temple in critical condition.
