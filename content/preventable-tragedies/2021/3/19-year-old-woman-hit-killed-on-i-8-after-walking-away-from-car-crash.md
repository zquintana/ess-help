The woman had crashed her Toyota into a center divider and got out of her car on the freeway

EL CAJON —  A 19-year-old woman who exited her car after crashing it on the freeway in El Cajon was hit and killed early Tuesday, authorities said.
The driver was heading east on Interstate 8 near First Street when she lost control of her Toyota Matrix for an unknown reason and struck the center divider, which sent her car into the traffic lanes of the freeway, said California Highway Patrol Officer Travis Garrow.

The woman then got out of her car, which was disabled in the far right lane, and stood near her vehicle.

That’s when a 24-year-old man driving east on the freeway in an Infinity G35 slammed into her disabled vehicle, which then struck her.

“This impact caused the female to be propelled into the No. 1 lane where she sustained fatal injuries,” Garrow said. The woman was hit by two more cars driving east on the freeway, he said.

The driver of the Infinity sustained major injuries in the crash and was transported to the hospital. He was wearing his seat belt at the time of the collision, Garrow said.

The other drivers involved in the incident were not injured.

The CHP initially said the victim was 20 years old. The county Medical Examiner identified her Wednesday as 19-year-old Chico resident Nadia Alatorre-McNeal.
