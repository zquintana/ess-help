A passenger inside a disabled car on the New Jersey Turnpike was killed early Monday after the vehicle was struck by a pickup truck, authorities said.

The crash occurred about 4:10 a.m. in a southbound lane at milepost 105.7 in Newark, according to New Jersey State Police.

The car became disabled in the right lane of the highway and was hit from behind by a pickup truck, according to Sgt. Philip Curry.The impact slammed the car into a concrete barrier as the pickup truck overturned, resulting in moderate injuries to the driver of the pickup, Curry said.

The driver of the disabled car suffered serious injuries and was taken to a local hospital, authorities said.

The southbound inner lanes were closed for about five hours after the crash, resulting in traffic backups, Curry said.

The names of the victims were not immediately released. The accident remained under investigation.
