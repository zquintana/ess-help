WEST PALM BEACH â€” A 17-year-old male from West Palm Beach died Tuesday night in a crash on Interstate 95 near 45th Street, the Florida Highway Patrol said.

FHP did not identify the victim or the two other people involved in the wreck. It stopped releasing the names of crash victims last spring, saying it did so to comply with a 2018 amendment to the state constitution giving crime victims and their families the right to withhold their names from public reports.The crash took place shortly before 7:30 p.m. when the car in which the 17-year-old was riding broke down in the northbound center lane just south of 45th Street in West Palm Beach, FHP said.An SUV did not stop in time to avoid a collision, although the driver tried to swerve out of the way, according to FHP.

Paramedics took the 17-year-old to a hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.The driver of the car, an 18-year-old man from West Palm Beach, sustained minor injuries. The driver of the SUV, a 30-year-old Palm Beach Gardens woman, reported no injuries.

FHP said its investigation into the crash remains open.
