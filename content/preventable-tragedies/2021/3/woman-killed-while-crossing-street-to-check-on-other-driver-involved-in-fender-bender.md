---
A 54-year-old woman killed Tuesday in a vehicle-pedestrian collision on Pawnee near Hillside had gotten out of her car after she was involved in a minor accident to check on the other driver, Wichita police say.

Department spokesman Officer Trevor Macy said the woman, Michelle Truong, was fatally injured shortly after 9 p.m.

“Through their investigation, officers learned that Truong was involved in a minor accident just east of the intersection,” Macy said.“As Truong exited her vehicle to contact the other driver and exchange information, she was struck by another vehicle as she crossed to the opposite side of the street.”

Trunong died on the scene. No one else was hurt.
