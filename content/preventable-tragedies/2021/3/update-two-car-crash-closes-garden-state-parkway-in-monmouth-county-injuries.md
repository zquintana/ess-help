NJ State Police are looking into the cause of a crash that caused injuries on the Garden State Parkway in Monmouth County Friday morning. 

Officials said the crash occurred at 2:06 a.m. in the Garden State Parkway northbound express lanes in Aberdeen Township.  

Police say the preliminary investigation indicated that in the area of milepost 120, a Subaru Legacy became disabled in the express lanes and a Kia Stinger traveling northbound struck the disabled car, which then hit the driver who was standing outside of the vehicle.  Police say the Kia operator was not injured and the driver of the Subaru was transported to an area hospital in serious condition.  

Police closed the express for approximately three and a half hours as detectives investigated the cause of the collision.
