CHESAPEAKE, Va. â€” State police investigated a crash that shut down a portion of I-464 near the I-64 interchange Tuesday morning and sent two people to the hospital.

Troopers were called to the scene just before 9:45 a.m. Initially, police said "several dump trucks and other vehicles" were involved. Both the northbound and southbound lanes of I-464 were shut down and traffic was rerouted to Military Highway.After some investigation, police learned that a dump truck broke down in one lane and was hit from behind by a tractor trailer. The truck caught fire and the cab of the tractor trailer was torn off and overturned, which partially ejected the driver.A Fed Ex truck swerved to avoid the crash but and flipped on its side. 

Medics took two people to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Most lanes of I-464 have now reopened, but crews are still working to clear the crash scene.

Authorities said some diesel fuel did spill after the crash and will be cleaned up.

No other details have been released at this time.
