A 56-year-old Jacksonville man was killed in a two-vehicle crash early Wednesday morning on I-95, south of County Road 210 in St. Johns County, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

FHP said preliminary indications show the sedan he was driving was either traveling very slowly or was stopped in the center lane of I-95 northbound at around 2:20 a.m. when it was rear-ended by a tractor trailer.

The sedan ran off the roadway to the left shoulder and collided with the guardrail, causing it to continue traveling north, the FHP report stated.
