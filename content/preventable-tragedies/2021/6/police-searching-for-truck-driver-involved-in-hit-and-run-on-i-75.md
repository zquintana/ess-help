Clayton County police are searching for the driver of a tractor-trailer who was involved in a hit-and-run on I-75.

Officers responded to I-75 North at the ramp to I-285 West shortly before 9 p.m. Wednesday after a HERO operator called about being hit by a tractor-trailer, a police spokesman told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Chris Canady, the HERO operator, confirmed with the AJC that he was the victim of the hit-and-run.Canady was on the ramp to assist a tractor-trailer that was stalled. As the driver of the stalled vehicle and Canady stood on the driverâ€™s side of the truck, another tractor-trailer attempting to pass on the left lane of the ramp struck the disabled big rig and both drivers, according to Canady and a news release.
