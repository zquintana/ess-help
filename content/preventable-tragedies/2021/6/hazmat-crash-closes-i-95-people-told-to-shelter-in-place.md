WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) â€” Delaware officials issued a shelter-in-place directive Tuesday afternoon for people within a half-mile radius of the scene of a crash on Interstate 95 near Wilmington involving hazardous material.

State environmental officials issued the directive following an early morning crash involving a trailer load of organic peroxide, which officials said is considered a hazardous material.The crash occurred near the junction of I-95 and Airport Road when a pickup truck pulling the trailer hit a disabled vehicle on the roadway, officials said.Response crews began burning off the peroxide at the crash scene shortly after 1 p.m.

I-95 remained closed in both directions because of the crash, resulting in severe congestion on many area roads.
