UPDATE (06/30) – The Tennessee Highway Patrol has released a report on the crash involving a deceased Jonesborough man who had been reported missing.

The body of Nicholas Todd was discovered by hikers Monday in a crashed vehicle in Unicoi County. Unicoi County Sheriff Mike Hensley said the vehicle was found in a creek on Spivey Mountain several hundred yards down an embankment.

The Washington County Sheriff’s Office confirmed on Tuesday that the body had been positively identified as Todd. He had last been seen by family members on June 2.

According to THP, the crash occurred in the 1300 block of Spivey Mountain Road.

THP reports the 2007 Hyundai Sonata was heading north when it “left the roadway on the left shoulder going down an embankment.”

The Hyundai overturned and came to a final uncontrolled rest on the driver’s side in the creek, according to THP.

The report states Todd had been wearing his seatbelt at the time of the crash.

Hensley told News Channel 11 on Tuesday that the vehicle was well-concealed from the roadway. THP made note of the difficulty in seeing the scene of the crash in the report.

“Due to heavy, dense vegetation off the roadway, it delayed discovery of the crash site,” the THP report states.
