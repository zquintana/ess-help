The Ontario Provincial Police say the eastbound express lanes on Highway 401 at Whites Roads in Pickering have reopened after a two-car collision claimed the life of a 73-year-old man.

OPP Sgt. Kerry Schmidt said the crash happened just before 7:30 a.m. Friday when a vehicle stalled on the right shoulder was rear-ended by another vehicle.

The man, a Vaughan resident, in the stopped vehicle suffered critical injuries and was treated at the scene.

He died a short time later, Schmidt said.

The driver that struck the disabled vehicle is a 17-year-old with a G2 license from Toronto, Schmidt said, adding that alcohol and distraction are being investigated as possible factors.Ornge air ambulance was forced to land on the highway to transport the person to a trauma centre, Schmidt said.

The collectors lanes were temporarily closed for the air ambulance but have since reopened, OPP said.

Police shut down the express lanes at Port Union but the highway reopened just before noon.
