HANOVER COUNTY, Va. (WRIC) â€” One person is dead following a crash Friday involving a tractor trailer and a pickup truck on Interstate-95 South in Hanover County, according to Virginia State Police.

One person was killed in the crash and others are being assessed for injuries, police said in an email. An investigation is underway.

The pickup truck driver, 54-year-old Candace S. Fields-Rogers of Alexandria, was killed in the crash. She was wearing her seatbelt. A man riding as a passenger suffered life-threatening injuries and was taken to the hospital.

All southbound lanes in the area are now open, and earlier delays have cleared.
