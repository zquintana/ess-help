title: "Good Samaritan Rachel Fleming critically injured after stopping to help at fatal Queensland crash"
---
A devastated community is rallying behind a young mum who was left fighting for her life after being hit by a car while selflessly stopping to assist at the scene of a fatal car crash in Queensland.

Rachel Fleming, 28, was struck by a car and left in a critical condition after she was the first on the scene of a head-on smash in Glastonbury, near Gympie, earlier this month.

Queensland Police say Ms Flemming, from Lagoon Pocket, was hit after a four-wheel drive and ute collided on the evening of June 3, killing the 51-year-old male driver of the ute.She suffered horrific injuries to her face, as well as fractures to her knee and ankle.

The mother of three was rushed to the Sunshine Coast University Hospital and was due to undergo facial reconstructive surgery this week.

A GoFundMe fundraiser has been set up by Ms Fleming’s friend Talia Eaton, which has raised close to $16,000.

Ms Eaton described her friend, who works as a teacher, as “selfless and kind”.“Our beautiful Rachel, a mother of three and devoted wife, was just inches from death after being hit by a car travelling at 90km when she selflessly stopped to assist a car crash on June 3rd in Gympie,” she said.

“The accident has left Rachel and her family in financial hardship. Rachel is unable to return to work indefinitely and her husband, Beau, needs to stay home and care for not only her, but their young family.“Rach never asks for anything. She is the kindest, most selfless human who stopped to do the right thing when the unimaginable happened.

“A little can go a long way, so please, if you can spare anything at all, it will go towards keeping a much-loved and deserving family above water while they take the time to recover.”
