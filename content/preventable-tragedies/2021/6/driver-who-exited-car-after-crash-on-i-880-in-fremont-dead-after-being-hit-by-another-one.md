A driver who got out of his vehicle following a crash on Interstate 880 late Thursday night died after being hit by another vehicle, the California Highway Patrol said.

Authorities did not immediately identify the person, pending notification of relatives. The person died at the scene.

According to the CHP, the person was driving a Toyota Camry southbound near the Alvarado Boulevard exit at about 11 p.m. when the car struck a piece of equipment — a metal and plastic attenuator — that began the split of the No. 3 and No. 4 lanes on the freeway as part of a long-term construction project.

None of the construction workers were at the scene and nobody was doing work when the crash happened, the CHP said.After the crash, the CHP said the Toyota became disabled and came to rest facing the northbound direction in the No. 3 lane. The CHP said the driver than got out of the car, stood in the lane second farthest from the left and was hit by a Ford Fusion.

The Ford driver stayed at the scene and spoke with the CHP. The agency said they do no believe the Ford’s driver was under the influence of drugs or alcohol but are unsure about the Toyota driver.

The crash blocked all lanes of the freeway, and a severe traffic alert was in effect until 1:15 a.m. Friday.
