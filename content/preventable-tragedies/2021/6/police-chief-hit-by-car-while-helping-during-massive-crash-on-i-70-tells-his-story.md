title: "Police chief hit by car while helping during massive crash on I-70 tells his story"

WEST NEWTON, Pa. — Mike Natale remembers February 6 like it was yesterday.

“I saw one car the whole mile ahead of me and it was stopped in the fast lane, in the middle of the bridge. No hazard lights no brake lights, nothing. He was parked.” Natale said. “If there was only one car to lessen the blow, instead of two, I doubt very much I’d be standing here.”

Chief Natale stopped to help on his way to his shift at West Newton, after he saw the van parked in the middle of the Speers bridge on I-70 and its driver slumped over the wheel. Moments later, Natale found himself in the middle of a second crash when a teen driver slammed into them, sending Natale to the ground and bleeding from the head.“All of a sudden the Good Samaritan screams out in absolute panic, not repeatable what he actually said, I turn and look, and there’s a car coming in the fast lane right at us, at what was later said to be 75 miles an hour. No sign of stopping, swerving, braking, turning,” explained Chief Natale.

The Smithton chief and West Newton police officer is back on the job but he’s still dealing with remnants of his injuries nearly months after the accident.

“The injuries were certainly life-threatening. I got excellent care from excellent people very quickly. But by no means is it over.”

He was just one of the good Samaritans who stopped that day to help. Another man driving by got out and was pinned between cars, with his pelvis crushed. The two men have remained close since having their lives changed that February day.

Natale has a strong message to distracted drivers who end up behind the wheel.

“Move over, slow down absolutely. I wouldn’t be doing this job if I didn’t believe in the justice system. All I hope is it’s fair but firm.”

That now 19-year-old driver, Brian Keegan, was charged with two felony counts of aggravated assault by vehicle, in addition to several other traffic citations.
