LITTLE POINT, Ind. (WTWO/WAWV) — One man was killed and another hospitalized Thursday morning following a three car collision on I-70, according to Indiana State Police.

The wreck occurred around 12:05 a.m. Thursday at mile marker 52 near Little Point, Ind. and killed Alfred Hill Jr. of Houston, Tex. The 37-year-old Hill had pulled over his 2001 Mack semi tractor-trailer, which had broken down, and was setting up emergency triangles on the side of I-70 when the crash happened, ISP Sergeant Matt Ames said.

Amer Al Fatlawi, 39, of Lincoln, Nebr., was driving his 1996 Freightliner semi tractor-trailer eastbound in I-70’s driving lane when at the last second he saw Hill’s semi and tried to swerve into the passing lane. Hill’s semi was reportedly sticking out into the driving lane and did not have its lights on.

However, another driver was in the passing lane as Al Fatlawi attempted to avoid Hill’s vehicle. Christopher M. Lyles, 39, of Griffin, Ga., was allegedly driving his 2021 Volvo Semi tractor-trailer east on I-70 when Al Fatlawi’s Freightliner swerved and hit the passenger’s side of his trailer, according to a police report.

The collision between Al Fatlawi and Lyles caused both of their semis to run off the south side of the road, hitting Hill and his semi, Ames said. All three vehicles came to a stop in a ditch on the side of the road.

When ISP officers arrived on the scene, Hill was allegedly on the ground outside of his semi and pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Al Fatwali, who had non-life threatening injuries, was airlifted to Methodist Hospital while Lyles had no injuries from the crash.

Traffic was backed up due to the eastbound lane being closed until around 9:20 a.m. All lanes of I-70 are now open, Ames said in a Facebook post.
