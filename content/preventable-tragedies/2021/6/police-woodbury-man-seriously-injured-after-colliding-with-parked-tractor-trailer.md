A Woodbury man was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital with serious injuries after his vehicle collided with a parked tractor trailer Thursday morning in Islandia, Suffolk County police said.

Stephen Sherman was driving a 2013 Nissan Altima eastbound on Veterans Memorial Highway when his vehicle left the roadway near Old Nichols Road at 7:33 a.m. and hit the rear of a disabled 2017 International tractor trailer parked on the shoulder with hazard lights on, police said.

Sherman, 79, was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital where he was listed in serious condition.

The Nissan was impounded for a safety check and the tractor trailer was inspected at the scene by Motor Carrier Safety Section officers.

The accident briefly closed the highway at Old Nichols Road, police said.
