CASTLE PINES, Colo. (KDVR) â€” Colorado State Patrol says a woman is dead after hitting an elk on Interstate 25 near Castle Pines. More crashes in the area after the initial crash caused serious injuries to several people.According to State Patrol, two people from Minnesota struck an elk around 12:53 a.m., and pulled over to the left shoulder of the road near Happy Canyon Road. A good samaritan came to help, and all three people were outside their vehicles.

As this was happening, a Toyota 4Runner was driving southbound, and struck the elk lying in the road. After hitting the elk, the 4Runner traveled on the left shoulder, hitting the woman of the first car, and sending the other two men over the concrete barrier.

The woman was pronounced dead on scene.

After that collision, CSP says the 4Runner moved back into the southbound lanes and hit two other cars.

Nine people were sent to the hospital with injuries ranging from minor to life-threatening.

Colorado Department of Transportation said southbound I-25 reopened around 7:05 a.m. CSP says drugs, alcohol and speed are not considered factors in this crash. The crash is still under investigation.
