A Seaford man was fatally struck by a vehicle May 31 along Route 113 in Dagsboro.

The man, 21, had pulled over onto the southbound shoulder of Route 113 at about 10 p.m. when a Honda Accord driven by a Frankford man, 31, struck him in the left travel lane, said Master Cpl. Heather Pepper of the Delaware State Police.

The driver of the Accord did not see the Seaford man, who was wearing dark-colored clothing and was not using a light, Pepper said. The driver came to a controlled stop south of the crash scene.

The Seaford man was taken to Christiana Hospital by helicopter where her was pronounced dead; identification is pending notification of next of kin.

Neither the driver of the Accord nor his 5-year-old passenger was injured.

DuPont Boulevard was closed for about three hours while the investigation was completed and the scene was cleared.
