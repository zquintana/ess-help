---
A man and a woman were killed when they were struck by cars in East Hartford Monday night, police said.

It happened on Roberts Street, near Olde Roberts and Forbes streets, about 9:10 p.m., Lt. Steven Camp said.

According to a preliminary investigation, it appears the man got out of a car that was stopped in the road and was struck. When the woman got out of the car and went to help him, she was hit by a different car, Camp said. The man was struck a second time.

Both of the vehicles’ drivers stayed at the scene and cooperated with investigators, Lt. Josh Litwin said. Police don’t know why the pair’s car stopped in the first place.As far as how two people came to be struck by different cars, Camp said, “It was very dark.”

The police department’s accident reconstruction team is investigating.
