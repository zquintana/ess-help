title: "Ismael Escamilla Injured in Rear-End Crash with 18-Wheeler on Loop 20 in Laredo, TX"
---
Laredo, TX -- May 22, 2021, 20-year-old Ismael Escamilla was injured when his pickup truck rear-ended a disabled 18-wheeler on Loop 20 in Laredo.

Authorities say the incident happened around 5:25 p.m. near the intersection of Bob Bullock Loop and Interstate 35. Preliminary investigation suggests a commercial tractor-trailer was stopped on the left shoulder of the road due to reported tire problems. The driver told investigators he was about to place orange hazard indicators behind the truck when it was hit from behind by Escamilla's pickup. The force of the impact drove the pickup's front end and about half its cab underneath the back of the semi-trailer.

Escamilla suffered life-threatening injuries and was airlifted to San Antonio Military Medical Center. The driver of the 18-wheeler, later identified as 37-year-old Dali Olaf Silva Flores, was not reported as injured.

The crash remains under investigation. No further information is currently available.
