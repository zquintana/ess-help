title: "Woman tragically killed in freak A50 accident while standing at side of road"
---
 A freak collision saw a woman killed as she stood by the side of the A50 after her car broke down.

The tragedy happened after Kveta Hangonyiova's white Vauxhall Insignia broke down near Blythe Bridge.

She got out of the car and was standing by the side of the dual carriageway.

The 64-year-old's inquest heard how a lorry collided with her vehicle, which then struck Ms Hangonyiova and a man.

Kveta, from Burslem, was pronounced dead at the Royal Stoke University Hospital following the April 15 collision.

The second casualty - a 64-year-old man - was taken to the Royal Stoke in a critical condition, reports Stoke on Trent Live.

Further details surrounding the tragedy have emerged during the inquest opening into Kveta's death.

North Staffordshire Coroners Court heard: "A vehicle travelling eastbound has failed to see the car, or has not seen it until the last second, and has collided with the rear.

"This has then collided with the occupants, causing fatal injuries to the female, and life-threatening injuries to the male occupant."

Anyone with any information about the collision should call the police on 101, quoting incident number 617 of April 15.
