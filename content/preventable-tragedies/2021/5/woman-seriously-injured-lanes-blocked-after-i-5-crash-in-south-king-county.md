SOUTH KING COUNTY, Wash. - A woman was severely injured when her car was hit by a box truck along Interstate 5 in South King County during the Thursday morning commute, creating a huge traffic backup, the Washington State Patrol reports.

Troopers and firefighters responded to the scene, just south of State Route 516 interchage, at about 6 a.m. after receiving reports of a serious collision.

The mangled remains of a wrecked car and a damaged box truck were found at the scene. The driver of the car was found with serious injuries and she was rushed to the hospital.

A preliminary investigation found that the woman's car was stopped on the shoulder when it was hit by a box truck. The truck driver was not impaired but may have fallen asleep at the wheel, said Trooper Rick Johnson of the State Patrol.
