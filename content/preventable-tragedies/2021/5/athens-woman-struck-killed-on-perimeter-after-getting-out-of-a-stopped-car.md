title: "Athens woman struck, killed on Perimeter after getting out of a stopped car"
---
An Athens woman was killed Tuesday morning after she exited a car that had stopped on the Athens Perimeter and was hit by a passing vehicle, according to Athens-Clarke police.

The fatal collision was reported at 11:49 a.m. on a northbound stretch of the bypass between the Lexington Road and Olympic Road exits, police Lt. Shaun Barnett said.

Police said Angelica Johnson, 32, of Athens died from injuries suffered after being struck by the vehicle.

Officers investigating the death are faced with a double mystery. The car that Johnson got out of left the scene as did the vehicle that hit her, according to the report.

Police are trying to determine the identities of both drivers, Barnett said.“It’s an odd set of circumstances; not one we typically would have. We’re trying to confirm the make and model of the car she was in,” he said, adding there were other motorists who stopped and provided police with information.

“One of the things they are working to determine is the reason and what led to her being outside the vehicle,” Barnett said. “She was outside the vehicle prior to any collision, so in essence she was a pedestrian on the Loop.”The bypass was shut down for a period of time while police worked the crash scene, he said.

Police did not have a possible description of either car to release late Tuesday.
