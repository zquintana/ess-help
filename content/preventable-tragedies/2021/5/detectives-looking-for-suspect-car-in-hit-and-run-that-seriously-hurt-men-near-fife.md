FIFE, Wash. â€” Two men were seriously hurt when they were struck by a hit-and-run driver as they stood on the shoulder of I-5 after a crash near Fife.

On May 8 around 4 a.m., a gray 2010 Lexus sedan hit a guardrail on southbound I-5 at 54th Avenue East near mile marker 137 in Pierce County.

After the Lexus came to a stop in the right lane, the driver and passenger got out and stood on the right shoulder near the guardrail. A second vehicle heading south approached the disabled Lexus and swerved avoid hitting it. Instead, the vehicle hit both men standing on the right shoulder.

The driver did not stop and continued southbound on Interstate 5, leaving both men seriously hurt.

While unable to determine the make and model of the vehicle that fled, investigators said they believe it could have been a dark-colored sedan with possible damage on the right side of its front bumper.

Washington State Patrol detectives are hoping the public can help with identifying the driver and vehicle that failed to stop.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Det. Brooke Bova at (253) 538-3202.
