CHERRYHILL TOWNSHIP, Pa. (KDKA) – A man was killed in a three-vehicle crash in Indiana County.

State police say it happened Thursday afternoon on Route 286 in Cherryhill Township.

According to police, the driver of a Chevy Silverado came up on a disabled box truck and swerved to avoid rear-ending it. When he swerved, he crossed the center line and hit another vehicle nearly head-on. Police say a Dodge Avenger behind the crash hit the Silverado as it spun on the roadway.

The Silverado’s driver, identified by the coroner as 59-year-old Bernard Greene Jr. from Greene Township, was pronounced dead at the scene. The coroner says he wasn’t wearing a seatbelt and was entrapped in his vehicle. The coroner says he died immediately at the scene from his injuries.

The other people involved sustained either suspected minor injuries or none at all.
