title: "Franklin man dies after crashing into semi on I-70, Indiana State Police say"
---
A 55-year-old Franklin man died Thursday afternoon in an I-70 crash in which his car ended up under a semi, Indiana State Police say.

Randall Wilson was found entrapped and unconscious in his Hyundai — wedged underneath the back of a semi — around 5:30 p.m. on the westbound side of the interstate near Harding Street. Emergency crews pronounced him dead at the scene.

The driver of the semi was taken to a hospital with what police described as minor injuries.

Police say the semi driver pulled over to the right shoulder and stopped because of mechanical issues. Wilson’s Hyundai, police said, came onto the same shoulder “for unknown reasons” and hit the rear of the semi.

The crash closed the two right lanes of I-70 for four hours while police investigated and removed wreckage.

The Indianapolis Fire Department, Indiana Department of Transportation and Marion County Coroner’s Office assisted in the ongoing investigation.
