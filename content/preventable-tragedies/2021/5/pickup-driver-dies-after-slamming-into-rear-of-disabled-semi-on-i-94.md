title: "PICKUP DRIVER DIES AFTER SLAMMING INTO REAR OF DISABLED SEMI ON I-94"
---
An elderly Milwaukee man was killed when his pickup truck slammed into the rear-end of a disabled semi along Westbound I-94 in Paw Paw Township last night, and police are trying to determine why he veered from the roadway to shoulder where the commercial trucker was inspecting a possible mechanical issue with his rig.

Michigan State Police from the Paw Paw Post tell us that last evening, Tuesday, May 18th, troopers responded to a crash involving a semi tractor-trailer around 9:55 pm on Westbound I-94 near mile marker #56 in Paw Paw Township.

Lt. DuWayne Robinson says that preliminary investigation shows the driver of the semi stopped on the shoulder to inspect his rig for a possible mechanical issue. While the semi was parked, the driver of a Ford pickup truck traveling in the same direction veered off the roadway and rear-ended the back of the parked semi. Robinson says it is unknown what caused the man in the pickup to leave the roadway.

The driver of the pickup, an 81-year-old man from Milwaukee, succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the semi, a 21-year-old man, was unhurt. The name of the deceased is being withheld pending notification of next of kin.
