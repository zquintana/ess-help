A South Jersey motorist died of his injuries over the weekend after his vehicle veered off Interstate 295 and struck a stopped SUV, authorities said.

Curtis Lockwood, 66, of Swedesboro, was driving southbound near milepost 8.2 in Oldmans Township in Salem County just before 2 p.m. Saturday when his SUV left the roadway and hit a vehicle parked on the right shoulder because of a mechanical issue, according to a New Jersey State Police spokesman. Both vehicles overturned and Lockwood was killed, police said.

The driver of the stopped vehicle, a 29-year-old man from Wilmington, Delaware, who had remained in his SUV, suffered minor injuries.

Police said the cause of the crash remains under investigation and no charges have been filed.

The highwayâ€™s southbound lanes were shut down for four hours for the cleanup and investigation.
