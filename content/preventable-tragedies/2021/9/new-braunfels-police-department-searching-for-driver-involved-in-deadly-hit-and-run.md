The New Braunfels Police Department are searching for the driver involved in a deadly hit-and-run crash early Saturday morning.

It happened around 8:30 a.m. in the 1000 block of Interstate 35 North at Highway 46 in the northbound lanes.

When officers arrived on scene they found the driver of an 18-wheeler pulled over on the shoulder of the highway and was standing near the back left corner of the trailer when he was hit by a car traveling northbound.

The driver of the 18-wheeler, a 54-year old male from Dale, Texas, died. The suspect's vehicle is reportedly a silver 4-door Dodge Neon. Police say the driver of the car attempted to swerve away from the trailer on the shoulder and struck the driver as well as the back of the 18-wheeler.

Police say the driver of the sedan did not stop to render aid and now the New Braunfels Police Department is asking for the public's help in locating the vehicle. Police say the vehicle could be a 2001 to 2005 model. The car will have significant damage to the right back passenger side.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call 911 or the New Braunfels Police Department at (830) 221-4100.
