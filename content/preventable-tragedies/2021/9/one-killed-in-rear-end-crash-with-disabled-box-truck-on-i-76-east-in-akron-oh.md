Authorities say the incident happened around 3:35 p.m. on I-76E near the exit to Lakeshore Boulevard.

The driver exited the truck and placed triangle reflectors behind the truck to warn approaching traffic, then went to the shoulder of the road. Moments later, a 25-year-old man in a Dodge Neon was reportedly unable to stop before crashing into the back of the box truck.

The Dodge driver was killed on impact. The truck driver, standing on the shoulder, was unhurt.

Police are still investigating the crash. They say speed was an apparent factor but are also considering the possibility of impairment.
