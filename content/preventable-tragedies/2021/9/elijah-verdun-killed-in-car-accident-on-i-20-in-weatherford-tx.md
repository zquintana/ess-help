Weatherford, TX -- September 15, 2021, 25-year-old Elijah Verdun was killed in a car accident along Interstate 20 in Weatherford.

Authorities say the incident happened around 10:00 p.m. on I-20 near the exit to Brock. Preliminary investigation suggests Verdun was traveling west on the highway when he lost control for unknown reasons. His vehicle left the roadway, hit a guardrail, and rebounded back into the westbound lane where it was disabled and had no lights on. Shortly after, another westbound vehicle approached and struck the disabled car, which the driver was unable to see prior to the collision.

Verdun was pronounced dead at the scene. The other driver was treated and released.

No further information is currently available.
