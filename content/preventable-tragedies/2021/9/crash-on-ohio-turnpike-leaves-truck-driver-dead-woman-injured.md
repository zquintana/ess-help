The incident occurred near State Route 83 early Tuesday morning.

NORTH RIDGEVILLE, Ohio â€” Troopers from the Ohio State Highway Patrol's Milan post are investigating a fatal crash involving two vehicles that happened early Tuesday morning on the Ohio Turnpike between State Route 57 and Interstate 480.

Authorities determined a 2019 Volvo semi-truck was traveling westbound on the I-80 when it went off the right side of the road and side swiped a disabled vehicle that was on the shoulder around 3:30 a.m. The stopped car, a Hyundai Santa Fe, was occupied by a 30-year-old woman from Ravenna.  She suffered minor injuries and declined to go to the hospital.

Once the truck struck the Hyundai, it continued off the highway and hit a guardrail and a bridge pillar at the Route 83 overpass. The driver was trapped in his vehicle and had to be cut out of the wreckage, and did not survive the crash.

The name of the truck driver who was killed has not been released yet. The westbound lanes of the Turnpike were closed for about three hours this morning.

The incident remains under investigation.
