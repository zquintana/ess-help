KILLDEER, N.D. â€” A crash involving three vehicles at 4:20 p.m., Friday, Sept. 17, left one dead.

The crash occurred along Highway 22, at mile post 99, just four miles south of Killdeer.

Alisha Bosset, a 24-year-old female from Dickinson, N.D., suffered fatal injuries, according to a report from the North Dakota Highway Patrol. Bosset was traveling northbound in a 2002 Mercury Sable when she crossed the center line and side swiped a 2014 Link Belt Crane, driven by 33-year-old Carl Aberle II, from Center, N.D.

According to the report, the Mercury then spun in the roadway and was struck head on by a third vehicle, a 2019 Ford F250 driven by Curtis Ylitalo, a 32-year-old from Dickinson. Aberle and Ylitalo's vehicles came to a rest on the southbound shoulder, while Bosset's vehicle came to rest in the middle of the highway, the report says.

Bosset, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was not wearing a seat belt at the time and was fully ejected from the vehicle.
