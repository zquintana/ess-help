---
A 49-year-old Irvine resident was killed in a hit-and-run collision on the 15 Freeway in Corona and California Highway Patrol officials are asking for help to find the driver of the tractor-trailer that struck and fatally injured him.

According to a news report in The Orange County Register, the fatal crash occurred on the southbound 15 at El Cerrito Road and was reported to the CHP early on the morning of Sept. 21.Officials said the victim drove an Acura that was in an earlier collision with a big rig on the southbound 15. After the crash, the truck pulled over to the right shoulder, but the Acura had become disabled on the freeway. The Acuraâ€™s driver and his passenger left the vehicle and went to the freeway shoulder. At some point, the driver returned to the Acura.

A semi-truck hit the driver as he was getting out of the passenger side of his car. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. The truck driver did not stop and continued south on the freeway getting off at Cajalco Road, CHP officials said. They described the suspect vehicle as a white or silver semi-truck pulling white bottom dump trailers. The investigation is ongoing.

We offer our deepest condolences to the family members of the deceased victim for their tragic and heartbreaking loss. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.
