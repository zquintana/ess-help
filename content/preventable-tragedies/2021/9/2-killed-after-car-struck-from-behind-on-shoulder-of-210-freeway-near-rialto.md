A driver from Riverside and his passenger died in an early-morning crash on the 210 Freeway in Rialto after their car became disabled on the side of the freeway and was struck by another car, the California Highway Patrol said Tuesday, Sept. 21.

Around 3:40 a.m. on Sunday, a silver Toyota Prius was headed east on the 210 Freeway, east of Locust Avenue, when the Prius became disabled and stopped on the freeway’s right shoulder, the CHP said in a news release. A silver Jeep Grand Cherokee was also headed in the same direction when the Jeep veered to the right and collided into the rear of the Toyota, the CHP said.

The driver and passenger of the Toyota sustained major injuries and were pronounced dead at 3:46 a.m. by emergency personnel, according to the San Bernardino County Coroner’s Office. The identities of the Toyota’s occupants were being withheld pending the notification of next of kin, the Coroner’s Office said.

The driver and two passengers in the Jeep sustained minor injuries and were transported to a hospital, the CHP said.
