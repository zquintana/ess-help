Senegal said after leaving the roadway, the Ford struck the trailer of a 2016 Peterbilt that was stopped on the shoulder of the roadway due to mechanical problems.

The driver, who was not properly restrained, sustained fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Senegal.

Senegal said the driver of the Peterbilt was not injured, and a toxicology sample was obtained from the driver of the Ford and submitted for analysis.
