Corona, CA -- September 14, 2021, 49-year-old Michael Pashley was killed by a tractor-trailer in a hit-and-run on southbound Interstate 15 in Corona.

Authorities say the incident happened around 3:55 a.m. on I-15 near El Cerrito Road. Preliminary investigation suggests Pashley was driving an Acura SUV when he was involved in a rear-end crash with a different semi-truck. Pashley stopped immediately in the slow lane of the roadway and exited his vehicle to check the damage. Shortly afterward he was hit by a second semi-truck pulling two gravel trailers. That truck did not stop after hitting the victim.

Pashley was pronounced dead at the scene. No other injuries were reported.

Police searched the surrounding area for the gravel truck but couldn't find it. The search continues.

No further information is currently available.
