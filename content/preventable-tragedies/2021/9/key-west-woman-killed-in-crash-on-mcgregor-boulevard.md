FORT MYERS, Fla. — A Key West woman was hit and killed in a crash on McGregor Boulevard on Thursday morning.

The 50-year-old woman’s Ferrari was disabled in the continuous left-turn lane on McGregor Boulevard near Camelot Drive just before 4:45 a.m.

The woman’s car was partially blocking the left southbound lane and had no headlights, tail lights or hazards turned on, according to Florida Highway Patrol.

The woman was crouched down next to the right of her car in the southbound lane with a portable fuel can. As she was trying to open the canister, a 61-year-old man driving a pickup truck was approaching in the left southbound lane.Troopers said there was traffic in the right southbound lane, so the man tried to swerve around the Ferrari. In doing so, he hit the woman.

The woman was pronounced dead on scene by Lee County EMS.

Troopers are still investigating the crash.
