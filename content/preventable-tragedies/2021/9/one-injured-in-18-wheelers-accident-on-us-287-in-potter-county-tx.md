title: "One Injured in 18-Wheelers Accident on US-287 in Potter County, TX"
---
Potter County, TX -- August 21, 2021, a 67-year-old man was seriously injured when two commercial trucks collided on U.S. Highway 287 in Potter County.

Authorities say the incident happened around 9:15 p.m. on US-287 near mile marker 124. Preliminary investigation suggests a Freightliner semi-truck with an attached trailer was in a prior accident and as a result was disabled in the left eastbound lane of traffic on US-287. The truck crashed and became disabled less than a minute prior to a Freightliner Cascadia 126 semi-truck towing a trailer approaching from the west.

The second semi-truck passed through debris from the first crash and by several stopped vehicles with their hazard lights on, then collided cab-to-cab with the disabled truck. The first Freightliner's cab slid leftward after the impact, while the second Freightliner drove off the road to the south and jackknifed.

A passenger in the disabled Freightliner suffered serious injuries in the crash. No other injuries were reported.

When interviewed, the second truck driver told police there were no active lights on when he struck the disabled truck. Police noted the presence of significant debris and active lights on both the disabled truck and two passenger vehicles stopped nearby on the shoulder.

No further information is available at this time.
