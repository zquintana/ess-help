TORONTO -- Ontario Provincial Police say that a female pedestrian was struck and killed while she was trying to jumpstart a car on Highway 401 near Whitby early Wednesday morning.

It happened in the eastbound lanes of the highway near Mill Street in Clarington at approximately 12:10 a.m., OPP Sgt. Kerry Schmidt said in a video posted to Twitter.

At that time, a male and female occupant were outside of a disabled Ford Mustang, which was stopped on the left shoulder of the highway, and attempted to boost the vehicle.


Schmidt said that the female was standing in a live lane of traffic when she was struck by “at least one or more vehicles.”
