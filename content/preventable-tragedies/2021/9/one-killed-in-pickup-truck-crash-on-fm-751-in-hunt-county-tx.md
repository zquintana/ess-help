Hunt County, TX -- September 18, 2021, one person was killed after one pickup truck hit another then fell off a bridge on Farm to Market Road 751 in Hunt County.

Authorities say the incident happened shortly before 9:40 a.m. along FM 751 over Lake Tawakoni, roughly 4.5 miles southeast of Quinlan. Preliminary investigation suggests a Chevrolet pickup truck and a GMC pickup were both headed north on the roadway when the Chevy lost a box of food onto the roadway. The driver pulled onto the shoulder to retrieve the box; moments later, the GMC pickup hit the box, then sideswiped the Chevy. It continued out of control and crashed through the nearby guardrail, falling into the lake below.

The GMC driver was pronounced dead at the scene. The Chevy driver was unhurt.

No further information is currently available.
