A Clemmons man was killed Thursday when the car he was driving crashed into the back of a tractor-trailer on the side of Interstate 40 in Burke County.Marcus Deal, 34, of Clemmons, was killed when the car he was driving went off the side of Interstate 40 and hit a stopped tractor-trailer, said Trooper D.R. Lane with the North Carolina State Highway Patrol.

The tractor-trailer had pulled off of westbound I-40 about a mile west of Exit 103 and had been there for only a couple of minutes before the crash occurred around 12:30 p.m., Lane said. The truck driver was the person who called 911. 

Lane estimated Deal was driving at least normal interstate speeds, around 65 mph, when he crashed. Lane also said Deal was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash.

It is unclear what caused Deal to drive off the road, the trooper said.
