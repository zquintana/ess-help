INDIANAPOLIS — One person is dead after a crash on I-65 Monday morning.

It happened around 5:20 a.m. near the 127 mile marker (at 86th Street in between the 71st Street and Whitestown/Zionsville exit) in the northbound lanes of I-65.

According to Indiana State Police, two cars were involved in the crash. A man was trapped inside one of those vehicles.

He was removed from the car by Pike Township firefighters and taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The driver of the other vehicle was taken to a local hospital and was last said to be “stable.”

Investigators believe the crash happened when a car going southbound on I-65 ran off the road and through the grass median and cable divider. It came to a stop in the northbound lanes of I-65. A Jeep traveling north then hit the idle car.

The man who died was the driver of the car that was originally going southbound on I-65.

Investigators do not believe drugs or alcohol were a factor in this crash.

The northbound lanes of I-65 were closed for approximately five hours while the crash was investigated and the scene was cleared.
