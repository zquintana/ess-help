RALEIGH, N.C. — A man was killed early Monday after being struck by multiple vehicles on eastbound Interstate 440 near Six Forks Road in Raleigh.

Raleigh police were dispatched at 1:39 a.m. and discovered the injured man, later identified as 27-year-old Cameron Scott Morrison, who they said was a stranded driver. When he got out of his car, which had broken down, he was hit several times.

It was unclear Monday whether the drivers who hit Morrison stopped afterward.

Raleigh police Lt. Jeffrey White said people with car trouble, including a flat tire, should immediately activate their hazard lights and move as far to the right as possible. Once there, he said, it’s best to stay inside your car until help arrives. However, if you don't feel comfortable doing that, exit through the passenger-side door and stand far enough away from the vehicle to avoid getting hurt by any potential impact from another vehicle.

“If you can get your vehicle to an exit or to a place where there is more room ... if you can keep the vehicle going, I highly recommend that," White said. He also urged other drivers to pay attention when they see a disabled vehicle.

"Slow down, [and] give that motorist plenty of room. If you are on a roadway where you can move over a lane, do so and slow down,” he said. "I believe inattention and sometimes paying attention to other things aside from our driving is causing some of these incidents.”

White said that, if you do hit someone, pull over immediately, call for help and check on the injured person.

“Anything you can give will be lifesaving for the EMS and firemen that will be responding," he said.

Eastbound lanes of I-440 were shut down for several hours between Glenwood Avenue and Six Forks Road while police investigated the incident. But the highway was reopened in time for the morning commute.

Anyone with information that may assist this investigation is asked to call Raleigh Crime Stoppers at 919-834 HELP.
