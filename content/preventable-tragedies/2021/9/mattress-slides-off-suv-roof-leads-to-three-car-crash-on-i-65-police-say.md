title: "Mattress slides off SUV roof, leads to three-car crash on I-65, police say"
---
A box spring mattress slid off an SUV roof onto I-65, leading to a three car crash Wednesday that injured three people, state police said.  

Indiana State Police said the SUV driver was being followed by a friend in their vehicle traveling north on I-65 near County Line Road when the mattress, which wasn't properly secured, fell into the roadway's center lane. 

The friend following the SUV stopped his vehicle on the interstate and got out of their car. The SUV driver pulled over to the right shoulder and ran across the interstate to help get the mattress.  

Another car headed north on I-65 struck the back of the car stopped in the middle lane, police said, causing the parked car to hit both men trying to pick up the mattress. Another car then struck the two cars in the road.  

State police said the two men in the road and a driver of one of the cars involved were taken to a hospital. Their conditions are unclear as of 6 p.m. Wednesday.
