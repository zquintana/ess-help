Newark, DE- Delaware State Police are investigating a fatal crash that occurred early Monday morning north of Newark.

On September 6, 2021, at approximately 5:13 a.m., a 2017 Toyota Camry operated by a 27-year-old male from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was traveling northbound on JFK Memorial Highway (I-95) in the left thru lane north of the Christiana Road (DE-273) overpass. As the vehicle entered a slight curve in the roadway, it drifted onto the left shoulder and sideswiped the concrete barrier in the center of the roadway. As the Camry continued traveling to an opening in the barrier, the vehicleâ€™s front left struck the impact attenuator, causing it to travel out of control and come to rest in the middle of the roadway with disabling damage.

Moments later, a 2015 Honda Civic operated by a 59-year-old female from Baltimore, Maryland, was traveling northbound on I-95 in the left-center lane, approaching the disabled Camry in the roadway. The front bumper of the Civic struck the passenger side of the Camry, setting the Camry in motion again. The Civic continued traveling onto the right shoulder and came to rest against the guardrail. The collision with the Civic pushed the Camry north before it came to rest between the two left lanes.

Several minutes later, a 2020 Freightliner tractor and trailer operated by a 41-year-old male from Randallstown, Maryland, began approaching the collision scene in the left-center lane. Due to the location of the disabled vehicle in the roadway and the movement of other northbound traffic, the operator of the Freightliner was unable to avoid the traffic hazard. The right front of the tractor struck the left rear of the Toyota and set the vehicle in motion before it came to rest on the right shoulder against the guardrail.

The 27-year-old male operator and 27-year-old male passenger from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the Toyota Camry were transported to a nearby hospital for their injuries. The operator was treated and admitted for his injuries. The passenger succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased. Identification is pending notification to next of kin.

The 59-year-old female operator of the Honda Civic was transported to an area hospital, where she was treated and released with non-life-threatening injuries.

The 41- year-old male operator of the Freightliner was not injured.
