Maryland State police are investigating a crash last month on the Beltway as a hit and run, in which a driver hit a man who was changing a tire on the shoulder.

Around 7:45 a.m. on Oct. 31, a silver vehicle crossed the white shoulder line near the interchange of I-495 and U.S. 29, police said in a press release on Monday.

The vehicle struck a 26-year-old man who was changing the driver’s side front tire of his vehicle.

The man was taken to a hospital to be treated for his injuries, police said. Ron Snyder, a state police spokesman, told Bethesda Beat on Monday that the crash wasn’t fatal, but he didn’t know the man’s condition.
