title: "VIDEO: Pickup driver doesn’t see overturned big rig in the roadway"
---
A truck driver’s dash cam captured the moment that a pickup driver failed to spot a rolled over big rig and crashed into the disabled vehicle at highway speed.

“Eastbound on I-20, an F150 going about 80 or more MPH hits a tractor-trailer that has been laid over. The F150 hits the unit so hard the pickup truck lifts the tractor and trailer and puts it back on its wheels,” the dash cammer said.
