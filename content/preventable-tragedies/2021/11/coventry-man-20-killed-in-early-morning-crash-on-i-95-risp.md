Christian Hull was standing in front of his stopped vehicle in the breakdown lane when his vehicle was rear-ended, pushing the car into him.

EXETER, RI â€” A Coventry man was killed on the side of the highway in an early morning crash on Interstate 95 South, state police said.

The crash happened just south of Route 165 in Exeter around 12:30 Saturday morning. A Honda Civic was parked in the breakdown lane with its hazard lights on. The driver, 20-year-old Christian Hull of Coventry, was standing in front of the stopped car, police said.

A Chevrolet Silverado entered the breakdown lane and was not able to stop in time, hitting Hull's car from behind. The collision pushed the Honda forward and into Hull, throwing him into the grassy shoulder at the side of the road. Both vehicles were pushed into the road during the crash.

A Nissan Frontier heading south on the highway was also unable to stop in time and rear-ended the Chevy.

West Greenwich emergency responders pronounced Hull dead at the scene, state police said. Neither of the other drivers were injured, and neither showed signs of impairment.

There was heavy fog in the area at the time, police said.

The crash is still under investigation, and any witnesses are urged to reach out to the Rhode Island State Police Hope Valley barracks at 401-444-1068.
