Nov. 4—VERNON — A Groton man who acted as a Good Samaritan when he and his fiancé pulled over to help a motorist whose car was disabled on Bamforth Road late Monday suffered serious injuries when another driver struck the two vehicles.

The Good Samaritan, Chuck McDonald, 45, of Groton, who is a mechanic, and his fiancé, Gelana Reeves, 30, also of Groton, were injured when, according to police, around 11:15 p.m. a pickup truck driven by Kevin Knowles, 44, of Vernon, first struck the disabled car, which was parked off the road, and then the pickup truck McDonald had parked by the disabled car.

McDonald, who had been driving with his fiancé in her pickup truck, said he had parked the pickup nose-to-nose with the disabled car, owned by Nicole Larkie, 40, of Norwich, as he worked under its hood to replace the alternator, the area illuminated by the pickup's headlights. At that time, Reeves was standing in the passenger side doorway of the pickup and Larkie was standing on the side of her disabled car that was off the road, he said.

The impact of Knowles' vehicle striking the back of Larkie's disabled car lurched it forward and sent McDonald into the air, then onto the ground, he said. Knowles' vehicle also struck McDonald's fiancé's pickup, causing that truck's door to injure Reeves, he said.

He also said his fiancé's pickup was hit several more times by Knowles as he tried to get around it. Police said Knowles left the scene and was eventually located and taken to Rockville General Hospital for an evaluation. Police said he was later released.

McDonald said he suffered lacerations, a broken nose, and bruising to his legs. According to police, both he and Reeves were taken to Hartford Hospital. McDonald said Reeves was released Tuesday while he was released Thursday.

The accident remains under investigation by police, with the assistance of the regional Metro Traffic Services, and no charges have been filed. Police ask that anyone who witnessed the accident or who may have information about it contact Officer Dominic Marandino at 860-872-9126.
