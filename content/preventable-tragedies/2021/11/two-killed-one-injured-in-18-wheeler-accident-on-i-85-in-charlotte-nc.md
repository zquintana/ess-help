Charlotte, NC -- November 24, 2021, two people were killed and one person was injured due to an accident on I-85 involving an 18-wheeler.

Authorities say they responded to the crash scene at around 2:00 a.m. The crash closed down interstate lanes between Freedom Drive and Billy Graham Parkway.

Right now, the details surrounding the accident are scarce. Police said that a Mustang became disabled along the southbound lanes of the interstate. While there, an 18-wheeler reportedly did not slow and crashed into it.
