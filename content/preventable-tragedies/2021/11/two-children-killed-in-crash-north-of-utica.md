Two children were killed and five more people were seriously hurt in a crash on I-80 north of Utica in LaSalle County Tuesday night.

The LaSalle County Coroner's Office says the two who died were an eight-year-old boy and a twelve-year-old girl, both of Peru.

Illinois State Police District 17 says a vehicle with seven passengers hit an abandoned straight truck on the highway shoulder. Police say in addition to the two juveniles who were killed, two adults and three more children were taken to an area hospital in serious to life-threatening condition.

The crash happened in the westbound I-80 lanes which were closed for a time for an investigation.
