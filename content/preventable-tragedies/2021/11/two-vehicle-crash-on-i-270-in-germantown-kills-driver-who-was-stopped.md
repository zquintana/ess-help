A Hyattsville man was killed early Friday morning when a truck carrying an intermodal trailer struck his car on Interstate 270 in Germantown, according to Maryland State police.

Around 2 a.m. Friday, Andres A. Landaeta Yaguaro, 31, was stopped in his 2016 Ford Fusion in one of the northbound lanes on the interstate just south of Middlebrook Road, according to a statement from state police.

Police said they donâ€™t know why he was stopped.

Darell Jamar Wright, 33, of Virginia Beach, Va., was driving a 2000 Kenworth truck pulling an intermodal trailer when he hit the rear of the Ford Fusion, according to police.

Yaguaro died at the scene. Wright was not injured.

Elena Russo, a police spokeswoman, wrote in an email to Bethesda Beat that the case remains active and that charges would be pending the outcome of the investigation.
