NETHER PROVIDENCE  –  A serious accident closed down Interstate 476 northbound between MacDade Boulevard and Baltimore Pike Friday due to a vehicle and tractor-trailer accident.

A Honda sedan was under the rear of a tractor-trailer in the breakdown lane of the road about 10:30 a.m.

Nether Providence police release an alert at 11:20 a.m. stating that the road could be closed for some time. Police were turning traffic around that was stuck behind the accident. The southbound lanes were also backed up as traffic slowed while passing and for the numerous emergency units.

The road was reopened by 1 p.m.
