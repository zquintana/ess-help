SHEPHERDSVILLE, Ky. â€”
A woman who police have been searching for nearly a day has been found alive off of Interstate 65 in Shepherdsville, Kentucky.

Nora Thompson was driving when she went off of the road on Monday.

Shepherdsville Police Chief Rick McCubbin said they received a call around 8 p.m. that night from a disoriented Thompson. They think the crash happened as early as 3:45 p.m.

She left the roadway near a ramp and took out a lamppost, police said.

Her family had been in contact with her, but were unable to find her exact location. Police said they searched day and night.

They tried to ping her cellphone, but McCubbin said it did not provide an exact location.

He said they started looking again as soon as the sun came up on Tuesday.

Around 11 a.m., she was found inside her crashed vehicle, which went into a cluster of trees down in an embankment not far from the road, making it difficult to see.They found her with help from a helicopter. She was upside down in the vehicle and had blood on her face, police said.

McCubbin said she was conscious and a little bit confused. Some of her injuries were serious, but he said they appear to be non-life-threatening.

Crews were able to get her out of the SUV using the jaws of life, and put her into an ambulance.The SUV was pulled up to the road around 11:45 a.m.

Police said the community was invested in finding Thompson, many showing up to police asking where they could look and telling them where investigators should go.
