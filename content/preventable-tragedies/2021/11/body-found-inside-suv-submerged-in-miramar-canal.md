A body was discovered inside a car that was found submerged in a canal in Miramar Thursday, officials said.

Police responded to the area behind an IHOP on Miramar Parkway and University Drive in reference to a missing person.

After a tow truck removed a white Jeep from the water, a man's body was found inside, Miramar police said.

Police said they don't know how long the Jeep had been in the water.

Authorities did not give any other details of the incident or the body.
