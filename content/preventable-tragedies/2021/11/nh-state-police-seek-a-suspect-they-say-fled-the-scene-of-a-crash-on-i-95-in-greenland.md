GREENLAND â€” New Hampshire State Police are looking to identify a driver they say fled the scene of a crash on Interstate 95 northbound in Greenland early Sunday morning.

Members of New Hampshire State Police Troop A received a report at approximately 2:13 a.m. about the accident.

The unknown operator who left the scene was driving a 2006 Chevrolet Equinox, police said, adding a preliminary investigation determined it had been involved in a prior rollover crash on the roadway. As the disabled vehicle lay on its side in the left roadway lane, a second vehicle, a 2014 Toyota Camry, struck it.

Witnesses told state police that the unidentified operator of the 2006 Chevrolet Equinox fled the scene on foot and traveled east into the woods. In a Monday afternoon press release, state police said the unidentified operator was described to them as a male clad in a black jacket with a fur-lined hood.

The operator of the 2014 Toyota Camry was identified as a 26-year-old from Portland, Maine, who sustained serious but non-life threatening injuries, state police said. He and a 25-year-old passenger, who sustained minor injuries in the collision, were both transported to Portsmouth Regional Hospital for treatment after the crash.
