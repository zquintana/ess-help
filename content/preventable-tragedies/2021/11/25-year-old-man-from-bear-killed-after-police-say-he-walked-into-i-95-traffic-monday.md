A 25-year-old man from Bear died Monday morning after being hit by a tow truck on I-95 near New Castle, according to Delaware State Police.

The man – who has not yet been identified by police – had initially pulled over onto the right shoulder of the highway, police said. Then, at about 11:44 a.m., he got out of his car and walked into the right lane of northbound traffic. Police said they do not know why he left his vehicle.

As the man was exiting his car, he walked into the path of a tow truck heading north on I-95, according to police. The driver attempted to swerve out of the way, police said, but ended up hitting the man in the road. Police said the pedestrian died on the scene. There was no one else in the car with him.

The tow truck driver, a 51-year-old man from Clayton, was not injured, police said.

The crash shut down the right two lanes of I-95 north near the exit to Route 141 for three hours, leaving traffic backed up all the way past Christiana Mall.

Anyone with information about the crash is asked to call Detective Anthony Tenebruso at 302-365-8435 or contact Delaware Crime Stoppers at 800-TIP-3333.
