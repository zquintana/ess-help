Police say that a truck driver was killed on Thursday night after losing control and crashing into another vehicle on an icy San Antonio bridge.

The incident began just before 8 p.m. on February 18 on the I-10 bridge over FM 1516 on the Far East side of the city.

According to the San Antonio Police Department, an SUV spun out and hit a wall on the bridge amid icy road conditions. The SUV driver was able to get out of the vehicle but the disabled SUV remained in the active lanes of traffic.A semi truck driver traveling on I-10 at speeds that police say were “too fast for road conditions” saw the abandoned vehicle and tried to slow and jackknifed, colliding with a wall.

The truck driver was reportedly not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected.

A second semi truck driver tried to slow to avoid the first crashed truck and flipped a trailer.

The truck driver who was ejected was taken to a local hospital, where he later passed away from his injuries. He was 51.
