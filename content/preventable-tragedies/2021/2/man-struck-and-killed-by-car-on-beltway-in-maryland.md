A man was struck and killed by a car as he was running back to his disabled vehicle on the Beltway in the New Carrollton area.

Maryland State Police said the crash happened around 12:40 p.m. Wednesday along the outer loop of the Beltway near Route 450.

An initial investigation found that a man was “running from the right shoulder across the highway to the left shoulder where his vehicle was disabled” when he was struck by a Honda Accord.

Police said the car had started to slow for traffic in front of it that was trying to yield to the man running across the roadway, but the Honda hit him in the left lane of the highway. The driver stayed on the scene, according to police.

Officials said the victim was taken to a hospital, where he died. He was later identified as Ryan Cain, 26, of Virginia.

Police said the crash remains under investigation.
