BOYNTON BEACH â€” A 54-year-old Fort Lauderdale man was killed Saturday afternoon after he was hit by two vehicles when he stopped his car on Congress Avenue in Boynton Beach to adjust a piece of furniture that was strapped to the roof. 

James Benson was taken by helicopter to Delray Medical Center after the 12:30 p.m. accident, but he died early Sunday, according to the Boynton Beach Police Department.

Benson and his vehicle were struck by a white 2020 Toyota Tacoma and a silver 2005 Chevrolet Colorado. Neither of the drivers of the other vehicles were injured. 

The department is asking anyone with information or video of the accident to contact Traffic Homicide Investigator Dennis Castro at 561-732-8116.
