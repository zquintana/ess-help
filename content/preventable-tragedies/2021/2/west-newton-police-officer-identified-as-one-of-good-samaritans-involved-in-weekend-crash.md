title: "West Newton police officer identified as one of good Samaritans involved in weekend crash"

WEST NEWTON, Pa. â€”
A West Newton police officer is one of the good Samaritans injured in a weekend crash along the Belle-Vernon Speers Bridge.

West Newton Mayor Mary Popovich identified the officer as Mike Natale."I spoke with him on the phone and he's resting comfortably and he expects a full recovering which we're so happy," she said. "Ever since I met him you could tell he's kind, he's generous, he's a very caring officer. He does good community policing."

State police said Officer Natale was on his way to work on Saturday when he and another good Samaritan stopped to help the driver of a disabled vehicle along the Belle-Vernon Speers Bridge. State police say another driver smashed into one of their stopped cars which caused a chain reaction, hitting Natale and the other good Samaritan.

"It's disheartening to see this happen to people who are good spirited and just trying to lend a hand to somebody who needs help," said Trooper Robert Broadwater. "This is a very bad stretch of road. We get crashes here all the time. That is why it's 45 mph through here. With that said, this crash should not have happened. The reason why is the speed limit is 45 through here. It's a straight-away, downhill, you can see what's going on in front of you. There's no reason for a disabled motorist and two good Samaritans to pull over and get hit from behind. There's no reason for it."

State police said that driver stayed on scene, and it's unclear if they're facing any charges, but the accident remains under investigation.

Natale is also a member of the Roscoe Volunteer Fire Company and is expected to make a full recovery. Troopers say the other good Samaritan is expected to be okay.

State police and Mayor Popovich say drivers need to slow down and pay attention.

"I just ask people to please pay attention and follow the move over law," said Popovich. "That's the reason it was put into place because there have been so many people killed."
