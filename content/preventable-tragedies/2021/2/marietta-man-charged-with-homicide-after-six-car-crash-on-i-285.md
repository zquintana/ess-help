---
COBB COUNTY, GA — A Marietta man crashed his car into a concrete barrier on I-285 near Powers Ferry Road early Sunday, Cobb police said. He's now been charged with vehicular homicide in addition to other crimes.

Around 2:25 a.m. Sunday, Feb. 7, 23-year-old Rony Perez-Lucas of Marietta was driving a maroon 2002 Toyota Tundra eastbound on the interstate, east of Powers Ferry Road and approaching the Fulton County line, according to the Cobb County Police Department. "For unknown reasons," Perez-Lucas left the road and collided with the concrete barrier separating the eastbound and westbound lanes.

Perez-Lucas didn't stay at the scene. He ran east into Fulton County, leaving his car in the roadway.Andrew Omoregbe, 67, was driving a black 2018 Hyundai Sonata eastbound on I-285 when he crashed into the abandoned Tundra, sending it east where it collided with a 2017 Chevrolet Silverado. The Sonata was redirected northeast as it exited the travel lanes and collided with the same concrete barrier.

The Silverado's collision with the disabled car pushed the Tundra into another lane, where three additional vehicles — a blue 2012 Audi A5, a gray 2020 Chrysler Pacifica and a black 2010 Nissan Maxima — were involved in the collision sequence, hitting either the Tundra, Sonata or Silverado.Omoregbe was transported to Wellstar Atlanta Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. Omoregbe's passenger, 42-year-old Stacey Render of Atlanta, was taken to Wellstar Kennestone Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries as well.

The driver of the Silverado, 32-year-old Desmond Graham of Columbus, was fatally injured and died on the scene. The drivers of the Audi A5, Pacifica and Maxima — Dajuan Williams, 24, of Norcross; Lewis Newmark, 63, of Chamblee; and Nathaniel Skrine, 21, of Atlanta, respectively — were not injured.

Perez-Lucas was taken into custody later in the day Sunday and transported to the Cobb County Adult Detention Center. He is charged with driving without a license, felony hit and run, failure to maintain lane and first degree vehicular homicide, and remains in jail without bond.
