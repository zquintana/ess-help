---
A young Fremont man who had been missing for almost a week was found dead inside an overturned vehicle Saturday in an unincorporated area of Alameda County.

The wreck was reported around 10:30 a.m. off Calaveras Road near the Sunol Regional Wilderness, north of Calaveras Reservoir, said the Dublin office of the California Highway Patrol.

A bicyclist who had stopped on the shoulder near Welch Creek Road saw a gray Toyota Camry upside down about 100 feet below the roadway.

Alameda County Fire Department firefighters rappelled into the ravine and found the driver dead in the car.There were no skid marks where the car left the roadway, the CHP said.

The CHP said the dead man was confirmed to be a 19-year-old student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who had last been seen by his family in Fremont on Feb. 21. He had reportedly gone out to buy dog food that evening and never returned.

The crash site is about a 20-mile drive from his home.
