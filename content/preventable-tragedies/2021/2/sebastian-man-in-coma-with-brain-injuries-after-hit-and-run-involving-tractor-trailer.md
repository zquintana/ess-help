PALM BAY, Fla. (CBS12) — A hit-and-run crash involving an 18-wheeler leaves a young Sebastian man in a coma with severe brain injuries.

Now, 22-year-old Cameron Redstone is unrecognizable. His head is swollen, his face is bruised, and his legs are severely injured.

Since the Feb. 5 early morning accident, Redstone’s mom has been at his side every day, holding his hand and praying for a miracle.Tuesday was no different.

"It’s a really tough situation for his family," said Clinton Lanier, a Vero Beach attorney who was hired by the family. "His brain is swelling. He’s unable to breathe on his own. He has a collapsed lung. He’s on a ventilator and he’s having a really tough time and it’s just not his fault."

Lanier told CBS12 News what happened on I95, just south of Palm Bay around 1 a.m. that forever changed Redstone's life."There was a multiple-car collision," Lanier said. "Vehicles that were involved in the collision stopped except for a truck that came through 10 minutes later and hit Cameron’s car so hard that it was torn in half. He kept going. He left Cameron on the road."Now the search is on for that hit-and-run driver. So Lanier has been out, putting up flyers at truck stops.

"I’ve offered $5,000 reward for the person who can come forward and identify this truck driver," Lanier said. "And it’s just the grace of God that Cameron survived it all."

Now the family is asking for your help with any information that they need to identify the tractor-trailer driver.

Authorities are looking for a tractor-trailer with front-end damage to its white cabin.

Those with information are asked to contact Florida Highway Patrol.
