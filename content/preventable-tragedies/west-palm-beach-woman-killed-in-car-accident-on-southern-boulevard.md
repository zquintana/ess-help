A 60-year-old West Palm Beach woman who was helping a motorist pick up items on the road was struck and killed Saturday evening when a pickup truck crashed into her, deputies said Sunday. 

Tammie Sue Olbeter was pronounced dead at the scene of the 6 p.m. crash at Southern Boulevard and Kirk Road, according to a report from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. Her LinkedIn page indicates she was a property manager.

Olbeter, a pedestrian, was helping the occupants of a 2006 Ford pickup retrieve items that had fallen out of their truck, which was parked in the westbound left lane of Southern with its hazard lights flashing, the report said. Police did not identify the pickup's occupants.While the westbound traffic lights were still red, Ernesto B. Hernandez, 79, of West Palm Beach, who was driving a 2003 Dodge pickup, "failed to slow and yield to traffic and pedestrians," and crashed into the Ford pickup, police said.Olbeter and a second pedestrian, Sabin Davitkov, 58, of Palm Beach Gardens, were struck. 

Olbeter was killed, and Hernandez and Davitkov, who sustained minor injuries, were taken to a local hospital for treatment, the report said.
