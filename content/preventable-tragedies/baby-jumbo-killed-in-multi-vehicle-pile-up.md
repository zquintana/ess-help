PRACHIN BURI: A male baby elephant was hit and killed in a multiple-vehicle crash on a road through a forest in Sri Maha Phot district early on Monday evening, according to local police.

The elephant, around one to two years old, was believed to have strayed from its herd in the nearby Khao Ang Rue Nai national reserve.

Pol Lt Kittipong Seebut, deputy chief inspector at Rabao Phai police station, said the elephant apparently died after being rammed by a vehicle.

Krissada Nanon told police he was driving his Toyota pickup truck on the Khao Hin Sorn-Sa Kaeo road when his vehicle was overtaken by a car that later crashed into the elephant. 

The driver fled the scene in the car.

Mr Krissada said he pulled over and switched on the emergency lights on his pickup as he tried to warn oncoming motorists of what appeared to be the injured elephant.

Another pickup, an Isuzu, then stopped right behind his vehicle in order to help. Mr Krissada said that as he was trying to contact the authorities, a car hit the elephant lying on the road and the driver lost control before rear-ending the Isuzu pickup which then bumped into his vehicle. 

The second car that hit the elephant might not have seen the warning lights clearly.

Poonchai Kittinukulsak, the driver of the Isuzu pickup, said he was heading home in Chanthaburi when he came across the scene and decided to offer help.He was calling the 191 police hotline when the second car rammed into the rear of his truck.

A local source said the elephant may have crossed from Ang Rue Nai Park in nearby Chacheongsao province in search of food in the forests in Sri Maha Phot district. 

Along the road, signs are put up warning of wild elephants foraging which could pose a danger to motorists. However, few take notice of the signs. 

The elephant carcass was undergoing a forensic examination at a wild animal rescue centre in Nakhon Nayok.
